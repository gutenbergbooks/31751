<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Curator of the Department of Birds of the American
Museum of Natural History I have had exceptional
facilities for the arrangement of collections designed to
give students a comprehensive view of local bird-life without
confusing them with unnecessary details.</p>

<p>Among other aids to this end a collection of 'Birds
Found within 50 Miles of New York' has been placed in a
special hall and so grouped that the visitor who wishes
to identify some bird seen within these limits may do so
with the least possible difficulty. In addition to the
'General Systematic Collection,' containing specimens of
the 350-odd species of birds which have been recorded
from the New York City region, there is also a 'Seasonal
Collection.' This Seasonal Collection contains only the
birds of the month. Its base is the 'Permanent Resident
Birds,' or those which, like the Crow, are with us throughout
the year. To these, the migratory species are added or
subtracted, as they come or go. The collection of migratory
species is therefore revised the first of each month.
Birds which are due to arrive during the month are added,
those which have left us are withdrawn. The Seasonal
Collection thus <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'give'">gives</ins>  us, at a glance, a picture of the bird-life
of the month and correspondingly limits the field of
our inquiry when we go to it to learn the name of some
strange bird recently observed. In January, therefore,
we have not to consider the birds of June, nor need we be
concerned with winter birds in summer. The season of
occurrence thus gives us an important clue to a bird's
identity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>For somewhat more than a quarter of a century this
small collection has achieved its object so effectively that
I have attempted to embody the idea it demonstrates in a
series of drawings which have been admirably executed by
Mr. Edmund Sawyer. As foundation plates or 'collections,'
we have first two 'cases' of the winter land birds of
the Northeastern States, or from about Maryland northward,
containing the Permanent Residents, which form
part of the bird-life of every month of the year, and the
Winter Visitants, or those birds which come from the
North in the fall to remain with us until the following
spring.</p>

<p>Cases 3 and 4 contain the Permanent Resident and
Winter Visitant land birds of the Southern States.
Whether the student is in the North or in the South he has,
therefore, a 'collection' of the land birds which he may
expect to find during the winter months.</p>

<p>Cases 5 to 8 contain the migrants arranged according to
the order of their arrival from the South in the vicinity of
New York City. Since it is not practicable to have cases
containing collections of migrants for other latitudes, data
are given showing what changes in dates should be made
to adapt the schedule presented to other localities, including
Washington, D.C., Ossining, N.Y., Cambridge, Mass.,
northern Ohio, Glen Ellyn, near Chicago, and southeastern
Minnesota. The records for these localities are
quoted from the author's 'Handbook of Birds of Eastern
North America' to which they were contributed respectively
by Dr. C.W. Richmond, Dr. A.K. Fisher, William
Brewster, Lynds Jones, B.T. Gault, and Dr. Thos. S.
Roberts.</p>

<p>With these facts, the cases in a large measure tell their
own story, just as does our Museum Seasonal Collection;
but further to assist the student I have added what may
be termed a 'label' for each of the 'specimens' they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
contain. These labels include comments on each bird's
distinctive characters, a statement of its nesting and
winter range, the notes on its status at various localities,
to which I have just referred, and brief remarks on its
habits.</p>

<p>It is the specimens, however, not the labels, which
warrant the publication of this little volume, for I hope
that, like their prototypes in the American Museum, they
will be a means of acquainting us with "the most eloquent
expressions of Nature's beauty, joy and freedom," and
thereby add to our lives a resource of incalculable value.</p>

<p>While the birds in the cases are small, they are drawn
and reproduced with such accuracy that no essential detail
of color or form is lost. Above all, they have the rare
merit of being all drawn to nearly the same scale. One
will soon learn therefore to measure the proportions of
unknown birds by comparison with those with which one
is familiar, and since relative size is the most obvious
character in naming birds in nature, this is a feature of
the first importance.</p>

<p>The student is strongly urged <i>first</i>, to become thoroughly
familiar with the 'map' of a bird given in the frontispiece:
<i>second</i>, to use an opera- or field-glass when observing
birds: <i>third</i>, to write descriptions of unknown birds
<i>while they are in view</i> stating their length, shape, and as
many details of their color and markings as can be seen:
<i>fourth</i>, to remember that one is not likely to find birds
except in their regular seasons: and, <i>fifth</i>, to take this
book afield with him and make direct comparison of the
living bird with its colored figure. The wide margins
are designed for use in recording field-notes.</p>

<h2>BIRDS AND SEASONS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> a leaf unfolds or a flower spreads its petals,
even before the buds swell, and while yet there is snow
on the ground, the birds tell us that spring is at hand.
The Song Sparrow sings "Spring, spring, spring, sunny
days are here"; the Meadowlark blows his fife, the
Downy rattles his drum, and company after company of
Grackles in glistening black coats, and of Red-wings with
scarlet epaulets, go trooping by. For the succeeding
three months, in orderly array, the feathered army files
by, each member of it at his appointed time whether he
comes from the adjoining State or from below the equator.</p>

<p>Besides the Blackbirds, March brings the Robin and
Bluebird, Woodcock, Ph&oelig;be, Meadowlark, Cowbird,
Kingfisher, Mourning Dove, Fox, Swamp, White-throated
and Field Sparrows.</p>

<p>Near New York City the New Year of the birds has now
passed its infancy and in April each day adds perceptibly
to its strength. 'Pussy' willows "creep out along
each bough," skunk cabbage rears its head in low, wet
woods, and in sun-warmed places early wild flowers peep
from beneath the sodden leaves. With swelling ranks
the migratory army moves more steadily northward.
Species which arrived late in March become more numerous,
and to them are soon added the Vesper, Savannah, and
Chipping Sparrows, and other seed-eaters; and when,
with increasing warmth, insects appear, the pioneer Ph&oelig;be
is followed by other insect-eating birds, like the Swallows,
Pipit, Hermit Thrush, Myrtle and Palm Warblers,
Louisiana Water-thrush and Ruby-crowned Kinglet.</p>

<p>The true bird student will now pass every available
moment afield, eagerly watching for the return of old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
friends and more eagerly still for possible new ones.
But enjoyment of this yearly miracle should not be left
only to the initiated. We need not be ornithologists to be
thrilled when the Robin's song in March awakes long silent
echoes, or the Thrasher's solo rings loud and clear on an
April morning. The Catbird singing from near his last
year's home in the thickening shrubbery, the House Wren
whose music bubbles over between bustling visits to an
oft-used bird-box, the Chimney Swift twittering cheerily
from an evening sky, may be heard without even the
effort of listening and each one, with a hundred others,
brings us a message if we will but accept it. And I make
no fanciful statement when I say that it is a message we
can ill afford to lose.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;RED-WINGS WITH SCARLET EPAULETS GO TROOPING BY&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>With May come the Thrushes&mdash;Wood Thrush, Veery,
Olive-back and Gray-cheek, the last two en route to the
north&mdash;the Orioles, Cuckoos, Vireos, and the Bobolink
who began his four thousand mile journey from northern
Argentina in March. But May is pre&euml;minently the
Month of Warblers, "most beautiful, most abundant, and
least known" of our birds. To the eight species which
have already arrived, there may be added over twenty
more, represented by a number of individuals beyond
our power to estimate. We may hear the Robin, Thrasher,
and Wren, without listening, but we will see few Warblers
without looking; and this, in a measure, accounts for the
fascination which attends their study.</p>

<p>After May 15 there is an evident thinning in the
ranks of the migrating army, and by June 1 we shall
see only a few stragglers. The Transient Visitors will
have gone to their more northern homes and our bird
population will then consist only of the ever present
Permanent Residents and the Summer Residents which
the great northward march of the birds has brought us
from the South.</p>

<p>Although June may be called the Month of Nests,
nest-building begins long before the migration ends.
Some Owls and Hawks lay in March, and the Bluebird,
White-breasted Nuthatch and Robin have eggs by April
20, while most of our birds go to housekeeping during
the latter half of May. Nevertheless, it is in June that
their domestic life is at its height; and to the student of
birds' habits this is by far the most interesting month in
the year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i014.png" width="400" height="368" alt="TREE SWALLOWS ... RESTING IN ROWS ON WAYSIDE WIRES" title="" />
<span class="caption">TREE SWALLOWS .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. RESTING IN ROWS ON WAYSIDE WIRES</span>
</div>

<p>Birds that raise two or even three broods will still be
occupied with household affairs in July, but one-brooded
birds, having launched their families, will seek retirement
to undergo the trying ordeal of molt, whereby they will
get a complete new costume. Often this will be quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
unlike the one in which they arrived from the South&mdash;as
the student will discover, sometimes to his confusion!
In August, the Month of Molt, the seclusion sought by
many of our summer birds induces the belief that they
have left us, but toward the latter part of the month they
reappear. The first week in August virtually marks the
end of the song season. The Wood Pewee and Red-eyed
Vireo remain in voice throughout the month, but the
great chorus which has made May, June and most of
July vocal, we shall not hear before another spring&mdash;so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
short is the time when we are blessed by the songs of
birds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the feathered army has begun its retreat
to winter quarters. As early as July 15, Tree Swallows
will arrive and by the end of the month will be seen resting
in rows on wayside telegraph wires, or en route to their
roosts in the marshes. In the now heavily leaved forests
the returning Warblers and Flycatchers will not be so
easily observed as they were in May, but in September
they become too abundant to be overlooked. The southward
movement grows in strength until late September,
when the greater part of the insect-eating birds have left
us, and it is terminated by the frosts, and consequent
falling leaves, of October.</p>

<p>But just as in the spring some of the northbound
migrants drop from the ranks to spend the summer with
us, so in the fall some of the southbound travelers will
remain with us for the winter. The Junco, which we are
wont to think of as only a winter bird, arrives the latter
part of September to remain until April, and with him
come the Golden-crowned Kinglet, Brown Creeper and
Winter Wren&mdash;all to stay until spring. October will
bring the Horned Lark, Pine Finch, Snow Bunting, Tree
Sparrow and Northern Shrike and these birds with the
ones just mentioned, and the ever faithful Permanent
Residents, give us a goodly winter company.</p>

<p>But the possibilities do not end here; there may be
Redpolls, American and also White-winged Crossbills,
perhaps Pine Grosbeaks, and, best of all, Evening Grosbeaks,
who of recent years have been coming to us more
or less regularly from no man knows where.</p>

<p>So from one year's end to the other, there is not a month,
a week or day which has not interests of its own. The
bird student may pass his life in one place, but he can
never say "I have finished" for the morrow may bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
some new bird or new fact. How immeasurably this
association with the birds adds to the joy of life! What
new meanings their comings and goings give to the
changing seasons; the very air is made eloquent by their
calls and songs. Why should we not all "come at these
enchantments"?</p>

<p>The birds are arranged in the order of their arrival from the
South in the vicinity of New York City. Nos. 1-19, 22-24, 26,
27, 30, 31, 36-38 winter in the Southern (chiefly Gulf) States.
The remainder winter in the tropics and reach the Southern
States a month or more before they arrive at New York.
Compared with the dates here given for New York City,
Washington dates are from ten to fifteen days earlier; Boston,
about a week later; northern Ohio, eight to twelve days
earlier; northern Illinois, six to ten days earlier; southeastern
Minnesota, about the same as those for New York.</p>

<p>The birds are arranged in the order of their arrival from the
South in the vicinity of New York City. Nos. 43, 46, 47, 51,
57, 60-64, 67, 68, 70-72 winter in the Southern (chiefly Gulf)
States. The remainder winter in the tropics and reach the
Southern States a month or more before they arrive at New
York. Compared with the dates here given for New York
City, Washington dates are from ten to fifteen days earlier;
Boston, about a week later; northern Ohio, eight to twelve
days earlier; northern Illinois, six to ten days earlier; southeastern
Minnesota, about the same as those for New York.</p>

<p>Except when nesting Bob-whites live in flocks or
"coveys" usually composed of the members of one family.
Their song, heard in spring and summer, is the clear,
ringing two- or three-noted whistle which gives them
their common name. Their fall and winter notes, which
sportsmen term "scatter calls" are signals by which the
members of a flock keep within speaking distance of one
another. "<i>Where</i> are you?" "<i>Where</i> are you?" they
seem to say. As with other protectively colored, ground-inhabiting
birds, Bob-whites do not take wing until one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>

the covey seems to explode, its brown pieces flying in

<h2>GROUSE. FAMILY TETRAONID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CANADA SPRUCE PARTRIDGE<br />

<i>Canachites canadensis canace</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male is a grayish bird with a jet black throat and breast,
the former bordered with white; the skin above the eye is red.
The female is barred with black and reddish brown with a
black mottled tail tipped with brown. L. 15.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Northern parts of United States from New Brunswick
to Manitoba. Other races are found throughout the
wooded parts of Canada and Alaska.</p></div>

<p>An unsuspicious inhabitant of swampy coniferous forests.
Now rare in the United States. It nests on the
ground in June, laying 9-16 eggs, buff, lightly speckled
with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RUFFED GROUSE<br />

<i>Bonasa umbellus umbellus. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 3</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female resembles the male in color but has the black
neck-tufts smaller. The tail-feathers vary from gray to bright
rusty. L. 17.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern United States south in the Alleghanies to
Georgia. In the southern states the Grouse is often called 'Pheasant.'
A Permanent Resident.</p>

<p>Washington, not common P.R. Ossining, common P.R.
Cambridge, P.R., formerly very common. N. Ohio, rare P.R.
Glen Ellyn, rare and local P.R.</p></div>

<p>On our western plains and prairies there is a Grouse
which we call Prairie Hen and we might well apply the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
name Wood Hen to this Grouse of our forests. To flush
a Grouse in the quiet of the woods always makes the
"heart jump." His whirring wings not only produce the
roar which accompanies his flight, but they are also
responsible for the "drumming" which constitutes the
Grouse's song as sitting upright on some favorite log, he
rapidly beats the air with his wings.</p>

<p>The horny fringes which in winter border the toes of
the Grouse, or Partridge, as he is also called, form in
effect snow-shoes which help to support the bird on soft
snow. At this season they also feed in trees on buds and
catkins, and they may roost in trees or seek a bed by
plunging into a snow-bank.</p>

<p>The nest, lined with leaves, is placed at the base of a tree
or stump; the 8-14 buffy eggs are laid in May.</p>

<p>The Canada Ruffed Grouse (<i>B. u. togata</i>), of northern
New England and northwards is grayer above and more
distinctly barred below.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PRAIRIE CHICKEN<br />

<i>Tympanuchus americanus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Prairie Hen has a rounded or nearly square tail and a
barred breast; in the Sharp-tailed Grouse the tail is pointed,
the breast with V-shaped markings. L. 18.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Central Plains region from Texas to Manitoba, east
to Indiana. Migratory at its northern limits.</p>

<p>Glen Ellyn, P.R. local, S.E. Minn., P.R. much decreased in
numbers.</p></div>

<p>The Ruffed Grouse sounds his rolling, muffled drum-call
in the seclusion of the forest, but the Prairie Hen beats
his loud <i>boom-ah-boom</i> in the open freedom of the plains.
Hardy and strong of wing, he can cope with winter storms
and natural enemies, but against the combined assault of
man, dog, and gun, he cannot successfully contend.</p>

<p>About a dozen buff-olive eggs are laid on the ground in
April or early May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />HEATH HEN<br />

<i>Tympanuchus cupido</i></div>

<p>This is a close relative of the Prairie Hen, having the
black neck-tuft of less than ten feathers with pointed,
not rounded, ends. It is now found only on the Island of
Martha's Vineyard, but formerly inhabited plains or
barrens, locally, from New Jersey to Massachusetts. It
nests in June.</p>

<h2>TURKEYS. FAMILY MELEAGRID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WILD TURKEY<br />

<i>Meleagris gallopavo silvestris</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Wild Turkey was formerly found as far north as Maine

<div class="blockquot"><p>Except the southern little Ground Dove, this is our only Dove.
Its long, pointed tail and the swift, darting flight are its field
characters. It is often mistaken for the Wild or Passenger
Pigeon, now extinct. The two birds differ in size and in color,
but size is a matter of distance, and color, of comparison, so it
seems probable that as long as there is a possibility of seeing
a Passenger Pigeon, Mourning Doves will be mistaken for them.
L. 11&frac34;. The Wild Pigeon is about five inches longer.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America. In a railway journey from the
Atlantic to the Pacific one may expect to see the Dove daily.
Winters from Virginia southward, migrating northward in
March.</p>

<p>Washington, P.R., common, except in midwinter. Ossining,
common S.R., Mch. 3-Nov. 27; a few winter. Cambridge,
rather rare T.V., Apl. 8-June 18; Sept. 18-Nov. 15. N. Ohio,

Minn., common S.R., Mch. 15-Dec. 25.</p></div>

<p>Doves are particularly common in the southern states
where, ranked as game-birds, they are shot in large numbers.
The Wild Pigeon's note was an explosive squawk;
the Dove's is a soft, mournful <i>coo-oo-ah, coo-o-o-coo-o-o-coo-o-o-</i>.
During the winter, Doves are usually found in
small flocks but, unlike the Wild Pigeon, they nest in
scattered pairs. The nest is in a tree or on the ground.
Two white eggs are laid in April.</p>

<p>Washington, accidental; two records, Sept., Oct.</p></div>

<p>This dainty, miniature Pigeon is common in southern
gardens and old fields. It runs gracefully before one, and
when flushed rises with a whirring flight but soon alights,
usually on the ground. Its call is a crooning <i>coo</i>. The
nest is placed on the ground and in low trees and bushes.
Two white eggs are laid in March.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Head red, plumage with a brownish cast. Young birds have
the head covered with brownish down. L. 30.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Most of the Western Hemisphere in several subspecies;
in the eastern states north to northern New Jersey and,

<p>The 'Turkey Buzzard' has a wider wing-stretch and is
a better aviator than the Black Vulture. It is more a
bird of the country than the last-named species which is
the common Vulture of the streets in many southern
cities. Extremely graceful in the air, it is far from pleasing
when at rest. The two dull white, brown-marked
eggs are laid on the ground under logs, in crevices in rocks,
etc., in March in Florida, in April in Virginia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vulture of southern cities; a frequenter of slaughter
houses and markets. In flight the under surfaces of the
wing look silvery. It is by no means so impressive a
figure in the air as the Turkey Vulture. Two pale bluish
white eggs, generally with brown markings, are laid on
the ground under logs, bushes, palmettoes, etc., in March

<h2>HAWKS, EAGLES, KITES, ETC. FAMILY BUTEONID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SWALLOW-TAILED KITE<br />

<i>Elanoides forficatus forficatus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The head and lower parts are white, the rest of the plumage
glossy black; the tail deeply forked. L. 24.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Florida to South Carolina, and up the Mississippi
Valley rarely to Saskatchewan; winters south of the United States,
returning in March.</p>

<p>Washington, three records, Aug.; Apl. SE. Minn., uncommon
S.R., May 4.</p></div>

<p>Color, form, grace, and power of motion combine to
make the flight of the Swallow-tail an impressive demonstration
of the bird's mastery of the air. It feeds on lizards
and small snakes which it captures when on the wing
from the branches of trees. The nest is placed in the
upper branches of tall trees, 2-3 eggs heavily marked with
brown being laid in Florida in April; in Iowa in June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-TAILED KITE<br />

and black shoulders. L. 15&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Chiefly southwestern United States and southward
east to the lower Mississippi Valley.</p></div>

<p>This is a rare bird east of the Mississippi. It frequents
open marshy places and feeds upon small snakes, lizards,
grasshoppers, etc., which it captures on the ground. The
nest is built in trees, and the 3-5 eggs, heavily marked
with brown, are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MISSISSIPPI KITE<br />

<i>Ictinia mississippiensis</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A slaty-blue bird with black tail and wings and red eyes. L. 14.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southern United States, north to South Carolina,

and returns in April.</p></div>

<p>A low-flying hunter of insects, snakes and frogs. It
migrates in loose flocks sometimes near the earth, at others
far above it. The nest is placed in tall trees. The eggs
are laid in May; they number 1-3, and are dull white,
occasionally with a bluish tinge.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />EVERGLADE KITE<br />

<i>Rostrhamus sociabilis</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A dark slate-colored bird with a white rump and a rather slender
hooked bill. The young are quite different; black above, tipped
with reddish brown, below mottled and barred with black, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'redish'">reddish</ins>
brown and buff, but with the white rump-patch of the
adult. L. 18.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Tropical America north to southern Florida.</p></div>

<p>The Everglade Kite is found in marshes and about
lakes and ponds hunting for its favorite food of large snails,
which it extracts from their shells by means of its hooked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

nest is placed in bushes or among reeds. The 2-3 eggs,
which are heavily marked with brown, are laid in March.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MARSH HAWK<br />

<i>Circus hudsonius. <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 15</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The immature bird and adult female are dark brown above,
reddish brown below, but, in any plumage, the species may be
known by the white upper tail-coverts which show clearly in
flight. L., male, 19; female, 22.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America, wintering from New Jersey southward;
migrates northward in March.</p>

<p>Washington, common W.V., July-Apl. Ossining, tolerably

<p>The Marsh Hawk quarters low over the fields turning
sharply here and there to follow the course of a meadow
mouse in the grass forest below. As a rule the bird is
silent but in the mating season he repeats a 'screeching'
note. The nest is made on the ground in the marshes;
the 4-6 white eggs are laid in May.</p>

<p>This small, bird-killing Hawk dashes recklessly after
its victims, following them through thick cover. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
less often seen in the open than the Sparrow Hawk, which
it resembles in size, but from which it may be known by its
different color, longer tail, and much shorter wings. It
nests in trees 15-40 feet from the ground. The eggs,
3-6 in number, are bluish white or cream, marked with
brown and are laid in May.</p>

<p>This is the real 'Chicken Hawk,' but it is less often seen
and heard than the soaring, screaming Buteos to which
the name is usually applied. It resembles the Sharp-shinned
in habits but being larger may prey on larger
birds. The female may be easily distinguished from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Sharp-shinned by her larger size, but the male is not
appreciably larger than a female Sharp-shin.</p>

<p>The nest is built in a tree 25-50 feet up. The bluish
white, rarely spotted eggs are laid in late April or early
May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GOSHAWK<br />

<i>Astur atricapillus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adult is blue-gray above with a darker crown and a white

<p>Like its smaller relatives the Sharp-shin and Cooper's
Hawks, this powerful raptor is a relentless hunter of birds.
It is particularly destructive to Ruffed Grouse. Fortunately
it does not often visit us in numbers. It nests in

in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-TAILED HAWK<br />

<i>Buteo borealis borealis. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Figs. 5, 6; <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 13.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This, the largest of our common Hawks, is a heavy-bodied
bird with wings which when closed, reach nearly to the end of the
tail. The adult has the tail bright reddish brown with a narrow
black band near the tip. The immature bird has the tail rather
inconspicuously barred with blackish, and a broken band of
blackish spots across the underparts. L. male, 20; female, 23.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America, migrating only at the northern

<p>The Red-tail resembles the Red-shoulder in general
habits, but it is more a bird of the fields, where it may be
seen perched on the limb of a dead tree or similar exposed
situation. Its note, a long-drawn, squealing whistle, is
quite unlike that of the Red-shoulder. The Red-tail
feeds chiefly on mice and other small mammals. With
the Red-shoulder it is often called 'Chicken Hawk,' but
does not deserve the name. It nests in trees 30-70 feet
up and in April lays 2-4 eggs, dull white sparingly marked
with brown.</p>

<p>A medium-sized, heavy-bodied Hawk with wings which,
when closed, reach well toward the tip of the tail. It
lives both in the woods and open places, and may be flushed
from the border of a brook or seen soaring high in the air.
Its note, frequently uttered, as it swings in wide circles,
is a distinctive <i>K&egrave;e-you, K&egrave;e-you</i>, quite unlike the call
of any of our other Hawks. It is often well imitated by the
Blue Jay. The Red-shoulder feeds chiefly on mice and
frogs. It nests in trees 30-60 feet up and, in April, lays
3-5 eggs, white marked with brown.</p>

<p>The Florida Red-shouldered Hawk (<i>Buteo lineatus

Eagles are usually found near the water where fish may
be obtained either on the shore or from the Osprey. The
call of the male is a human-like, loud, clear <i>cac-cac-cac;</i>
that of the female is said to be more harsh and often
broken. Eagles nest in tall trees and on cliffs, and lay
two or three dull white eggs, in Florida, in November
and December; in Maine, in April.</p>

<h2>FALCONS, CARACARAS, ETC. FAMILY FALCONID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GYRFALCON<br />

<i>Falco rusticolus gyrfalco</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large Hawk with long, pointed wings, the upper parts brown
with numerous narrow, buffy bars or margins, the tail evenly
barred with grayish and blackish, the underparts white lightly
streaked with black. L. 22.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Arctic regions; south in winter rarely to New York
and Minnesota. The Gray Gyrfalcon (<i>F. r. rusticolus</i>) a paler
form, with a streaked crown, the Black Gyrfalcon (<i>F. r. obsoletus</i>)
a slate-colored race, and the White Gyrfalcon (<i>F. islandus</i>) are
also rare winter visitants to the northern United States.</p></div>

<p>These great Falcons are so rare in the United States
that unless they are seen by an experienced observer,
under exceptionally favorable conditions, authentic records
of their visits can be based only on the actual capture of
specimens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />DUCK HAWK<br />

<i>Falco peregrinus anatum</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adult is slaty blue above; buff below marked with black,
and with black cheek-patches. Immature birds are blackish
above margined with rusty, below deep rusty buff streaked with
blackish. L., male, 16; female, 19.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Northern Hemisphere, breeding south locally to New
Jersey and in Alleghanies to South Carolina; winters from New
Jersey southward.</p>

<p>Washington, rare and irregular W.V. Ossining, casual.
Cambridge, rare T.V., casual in winter, SE. Minn., uncommon
S.R., Apl. 4.</p></div>

<p>As the Peregrine of falconry we know of the Duck Hawk
as a fearless, dashing hunter of greater power of wing and
talon. It nests in rocky cliffs in April and from its eyrie
darts upon passing Pigeons and other birds. It is most
often seen following the coast-line during migrations where
it takes toll of Ducks and shore-birds. Three to four
heavily marked, brownish eggs are laid in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PIGEON HAWK<br />

<i>Falco columbarius</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A small Hawk, about the size of a Sparrow Hawk. The adult
is slaty blue above, with a rusty collar and a barred, white-tipped
tail; below buff, streaked with blackish. Young birds have the
upperparts blackish brown. L. 11.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Breeds north of, and winters chiefly south of the United
States. Migrates northward in April and May, and southward
in September and October.</p>

<p>Washington, not uncommon T.V. Ossining, tolerably common
T.V., Apl. 1-May 11; Aug. 10-Oct. 15. Cambridge, common

<i>Falco sparverius sparverius. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Figs. 7, 8; <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Figs. 5, 6</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male has the tail with only one bar; the breast unmarked;
the abdomen with black spots; while the female has the tail with
several bars, the underparts streaked with brownish. In both
sexes the bright reddish brown of the upperparts, black markings
about the head, and small size are gold field characters. L. 10.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Sparrow Hawks are found throughout the greater part
of the Western Hemisphere. Our eastern race inhabits the
region east of the Rockies and is migratory at the northern limit
of its range. Southern Florida specimens are slightly smaller
and darker and are known as the Florida Sparrow Hawk (<i>F. s.
paulus</i>).</p></div>

<p>The Sparrow Hawk is one of our commonest and most
familiar Hawks. He is a handsome little Falcon, and
though his prey is chiefly humble grasshoppers, he captures
them in a sportsmanlike manner by "waiting on" or hovering
on rapidly beating wings over his game and dropping
on it with deadly aim. His call is a high, rapidly repeated
<i>Killy-killy-killy</i>. The three to seven eggs, finely marked
with reddish brown, are laid in a hollow limb or similar
situation in April.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />AUDUBON'S CARACARA<br />

<i>Polyborus cheriway cheriway</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A falcon-like Vulture with a bare face, black cap, white throat,
breast and nape; the rest of the plumage is black, the tail barred
with white. L. 22.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Mexican border and southward; south central Florida.</p></div>

<p>In the eastern United States the Caracara is found
only in the Kissimmee prairie region of southern Florida
where its presence, so far from others of its kind, furnishes
one of the problems in distribution which stimulate the
imagination of the faunal naturalist.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><br />OSPREY<br />

<i>Pandion hali&aelig;tus carolinensis. <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 14</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Osprey or Fish Hawk is often miscalled 'Eagle,' but it is
a smaller bird with white, instead of blackish underparts. L. 23.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> The Osprey is found throughout the greater part of
the world; the American form occurs in both North and South
America and winters from the southern United States southward,
starting northward in March.</p>

<p>Washington, uncommon S.R., Mch. 19-Nov. 30. Ossining,

Ohio, rare S.R., Apl. 20-Oct. Glen Ellyn, two records, May
and Sept.</p></div>

<p>The Osprey, or Fish Hawk, feeds on fish and nothing
but fish. He is, therefore, never found far from his fishing
grounds, where no one who has seen him plunge for his
prey and rise with it from the water will doubt his ability
to supply his wants. Ospreys usually nest in trees at varying
distances from the ground, but sometimes on cliffs
or even on the ground itself, and return year after year to
the same nest. The Osprey's alarm note is a high, loud,
complaining whistle, frequently repeated. The eggs are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
laid in late April and early May. They are usually four
in number, buffy white, heavily marked with chocolate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A light-colored Owl, looking almost white in the dusk. L. 18.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Barn Owls are found throughout the world. Our
species is rare north of New Jersey and Ohio. It is migratory
only at the northern limit of its range.</p>

<p>Washington, not rare P.R. Ossining, A.V.</p></div>

<p>This is the 'Monkey-faced Owl' of towers and steeples.
Few who hear its loud, sudden scream or rapidly repeated
<i>crree-crree-crree</i> know their author, who may live for years
in the heart of a village a stranger to its human inhabitants.
The mice, however, have tragic evidence of his
presence in the nightly raids he makes upon their ranks.
The nest is made in the diurnal retreat, 5-9 white eggs
being laid in April.</p>

<h2>HORNED OWLS, HOOT OWLS, ETC. FAMILY STRIGID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LONG-EARED OWL<br />

<i>Asio wilsonianus. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 17</i></div>

its presence is often betrayed by the litter below of undigested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pellets of hair and bones which Owls eject at the
mouth. It is not a "hoot" Owl, and even many ornithologists
have not heard its notes, which are described as a
"soft-toned, slow <i>wu-hunk, wu-hunk</i>, and a low twittering,
whistling <i>dicky, dicky, dicky</i>." It is not a hole-inhabiting
Owl and like the Great Horned nests in an old Hawk,
Crow, or Squirrel nest. Three to six white eggs are laid in
April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SHORT-EARED OWL<br />

<i>Asio flammeus. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 18</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The 'ears' are barely evident, the eyes are yellow; underparts

<p>This is a marsh Owl and we are therefore not likely
to find it associated with other members of its family.
Its notes are said to resemble the <i>ki-yi</i> of a small dog.
Four to seven white eggs are laid in an open nest in the
grasses in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BARRED OWL<br />

<i>Strix varia varia. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 15</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large Owl with black eyes (the figure is incorrect) and no

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America. Generally a Permanent
Resident. The Florida Barred Owl (<i>S. v. alleni</i>, <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 16),
is somewhat darker than the northern form and has nearly naked
toes. It inhabits Florida and the coast region from South
Carolina to Texas.</p>

<p>An Owl of the woods, common in the less thickly settled
parts of its range. Its loud, sonorous notes, <i>whoo, whoo-whoo
who-whoo, to-whoo-ah</i>, are often uttered. When two
birds come together their united calls produce some of the
most startling sounds to be heard in nature. The Barred
Owl feeds chiefly on mice. It nests in hollow trees in
March, laying 2-4 white eggs.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GREAT GRAY OWL<br />

<div class='center'><br /><br />SCREECH OWL<br />

<i>Otus asio asio. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Figs. 13, 14</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The two sexes are alike, the two color phases being individual
and representing dichromatism. Among animals, gray and black
squirrels furnish a similar case. The ear-like feather-tufts give
the bird a cat-like appearance, hence the name 'Cat Owl.' The
young are downy-looking creatures evenly barred with dusky.
L. 9&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Screech Owls are found throughout the greater part
of the Western Hemisphere. Our eastern form occurs in the
eastern United States from Canada southward. The Florida
race (<i>O. a. floridanus</i>, <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 19) is smaller and of a darker
gray than the northern bird. The 'red' phase is rare.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge,

<p>This, the smallest of our 'horned' Owls, is also the commonest.
It lives near and sometimes in our homes even
when they are situated in towns. Its tremulous, wailing
whistle (in no sense a 'screech') is therefore one of our
most characteristic twilight bird-notes. Mice and insects
form the greater part of the Screech Owl's fare. Four to
six white eggs are laid in a hollow tree, bird-box, or similar
site in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GREAT HORNED OWL<br />

<i>Bubo virginianus virginianus. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 16</i></div>

<p>The Great Horned Owl retreats before the civilization
that destroys the forests in which it lives. In thinly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
settled regions its deep-toned, monotone, <i>whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,
whooo, whooo</i> is still a characteristic bird voice, but
most of us hear it only when we camp in the wilderness.
The bird's fierce nature has won for it the name of "tiger
among birds." Rabbits, skunks, game birds and smaller
prey form its fare. The 2-3 white eggs are laid in an
abandoned Hawk, Crow, or squirrel nest in February;
it is the first of our northern birds to nest.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SNOWY OWL<br />

<i>Nyctea nyctea</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large Owl with no 'ear' tufts and yellow eyes; chiefly

<p>Cuckoos are common birds, but are more often heard
than seen. Their notes are not like those of the cuckoo
clock, which exactly imitates the voice of the European
Cuckoo, but a series of <i>cuck-cuck-cucks</i> and <i>cow-cows</i>
repeated a varying number of times. The Cuckoo rarely
makes long flights but slips from one tree to another, seeking
at once the inner branches and avoiding an exposed
perch. The nest, a platform of sticks, thinly covered,
is placed in low trees or bushes. The 3-5 greenish blue
eggs are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK-BILLED CUCKOO<br />

<i>Coccyzus erythrophthalmus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 2</i></div>

preceding.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> A more northern species than the Yellow-billed

<p>The day after penning the foregoing notes on the Yellow-billed
Cuckoo, I saw a Black-bill make a prolonged, dashing
flight through the open, alight on the limb of a dead,
leafless tree, directly over a young girl who was calling
loudly to an active dog near her, and from this conspicuous
perch utter its low <i>coo-coo</i> notes, both looking and sounding
more like a Dove than a conventional Cuckoo. So while
we may say that the Cuckoos are much alike in habits
one must not accept generalized statements too literally.
There is much individuality among birds, a fact that makes
their study far more interesting than if all were cast in the
same mold.</p>

<p>The notes of this species are softer than those of the
Yellow-bill, but the difference between the calls of the two
species must be learned from the birds, not from books.
The nest of the Black-bill is the more compactly built of
the two, and its eggs are of a deeper shade.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Hairy is a large edition of the Downy with white, unmarked
outer tail-feathers. The male has a red head-band.
L. 9&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Middle and northern states; a permanent resident.
The southern Hairy Woodpecker (<i>D. v. auduboni</i>) inhabits the
southeastern United States north to southern Virginia. It is
smaller than the Hairy and has less white in the plumage. L. 8<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub></small>.</p>

<p>The Northern Hairy Woodpecker (<i>D. v. leucomelas</i>) is found
from the northern United States northward. It is larger and
whiter than the Hairy. L. 10.</p>

<p>The Newfoundland Hairy Woodpecker (<i>D. v. terr&aelig;nov&aelig;</i>) is
larger and darker than the Hairy; it inhabits Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Washington, rare P.R. Ossining, rare P.R. Cambridge,
uncommon W.V., one summer record. N. Ohio, common P.R.
Glen Ellyn, fairly common P.R.</p></div>

<p>The Hairy is not so common as his small cousin the
Downy, and does not so readily make friends. He prefers
the woods to our orchards and is for these reasons less often
seen at our feeding-stands. The Hairy's notes are
noticeably louder than the Downy's. The nest-hole is
usually in a dead tree. The 2-4 white eggs are laid
the last half of April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />DOWNY WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Dryobates pubescens medianus. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 26, 27</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Downy differs from the Hairy Woodpecker in color by
having the outer tail-feathers with black bars, but it is the bird's
obviously smaller size that will serve to distinguish it. L. 6&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> From Virginia northward into Canada. A Permanent
Resident. The Southern Downy Woodpecker (<i>D. p. pubescens</i>,
<a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 25) is smaller, darker below and with the white markings
smaller. L. 6. It inhabits the south Atlantic and Gulf
States north to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge,
common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn,
common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.</p></div>

<p>Our commonest Woodpecker; an alert, active little
driller for insects and their eggs and larv&aelig;, and frequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
visitor to our lunch-counters, particularly if we supply
them with suet. His sharp <i>peek, peek</i>, running at times
into a diminishing string of <i>peeks</i>, and his rolling tatoo, as
he pounds a limb with amazing rapidity, are prominent
parts of every-day bird language, the tatoo being a 'song'
of the breeding season.</p>

<p>Four to six white eggs are laid in a hole, usually in a dead
tree, the first week in May. The Southern Downy nests
in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-COCKADED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Dryobates borealis</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Between the Downy and Hairy in size (L. 8&frac12;) with a general
resemblance to both, but the male with a small tuft of red
feathers on each <i>side</i> of the back of the head.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southeastern States north to North Carolina.</p></div>

<p>An inhabitant of the pine woods, who utters a coarse
<i>yank-yank</i> note and may at times be seen feeding from the
terminal tufts of pine 'needles' in the higher branches.
The nest is usually in a living pine; the 2-5 white eggs
are laid in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ARCTIC THREE-TOED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Picoides arcticus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Two toes in front and one behind, a solid black back and an
orange-yellow crown in the male distinguish this from all our
other Woodpeckers. Size of the Hairy, L. 9&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Canada, and northern parts of our border states, rarely
south in winter, as far as Nebraska and Ohio.</p>

<p>Cambridge, one record. N. Ohio, rare W.V. SE. Minn., rare.</p></div>

<p>An inhabitant of the spruce and balsam forests of our
northern states, occasionally straggling southward in
winter. Nests in May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />THREE-TOED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Picoides americanus americanus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Two toes in front and one behind, an orange-yellow crest in
the male, and a black back <i>closely and evenly barred with white</i>
distinguish this bird; it is somewhat smaller than the preceding,
L. 8&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Canada, south to the northern parts of our boundary
states; unknown south of Massachusetts.</p></div>

<p>Not so common as the Arctic Three-toed Woodpecker,
and less often found south of its breeding range. Nests in
early June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER<br />

<i>Sphyrapicus varius varius. <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 26, <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 30</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female has the throat white, and rarely, crown wholly
black. Young birds have the throat whitish, crown dull black,
breast brownish. The black breast-patch and red forehead,
and red or white throat are distinguishing characters. L. 8&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England and Minnesota
(in Alleghanies from North Carolina) to Canada; winters from
Pennsylvania (rarely) southward to the Gulf States.</p>

<p>Washington, common T.V., Mch.-May; Sept. and Oct.,
Occasional in winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 5-May 13;
Sept. 18-Oct. 23; casual in winter. Cambridge, not uncommon

common T.V., Mch. 31-May 12; Sept. 14-Oct. 13. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 19.</p></div>

<p>This is the mysterious maker of the rows of little holes
drilled in even lines, like hieroglyphics, on the trunks of
apple and other trees. Using his brush-tipped tongue as a
swab, he drinks the sap that oozes from these punctures.</p>

<p>As a migrant the Yellow-belly is not conspicuous. His
business takes him into the heart of living trees and he is
usually seen only when flying from one to another. His
low 'snarling' note attracts the attention of only the
observant.</p>

<p>The nest-hole is 25-40 feet up; the 5-7 white eggs are
laid in May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PILEATED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Phl&oelig;otomus pileatus pileatus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Next to the nearly extinct Ivory-bill this is the largest of our
Woodpeckers. (L. 17.) Both sexes have a flaming red crest
(reaching the forehead in the male) the remainder of the plumage
being black, with the throat, a stripe from the bill down the
sides of the neck, and the basal half of the wing-feathers white;
bill horn-color.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southeastern and Gulf States, north to North Carolina.
The Northern Pileated Woodpecker (<i>P. p. abieticola</i>) is
found thence northward into Canada and west to the Pacific.
It is a larger bird, with the white areas larger.</p></div>

<p>In the south the Pileated is by no means rare and seems
not averse to the presence of man; but in the north he
retires to the wilder forested areas and we are apt to see
him only when we go a-camping. And he is well worth
seeing with his flaming crest and powerful bill which,
used either as a chisel or drum-stick, produces impressive
results. Strangely enough the Pileated's notes
resemble those of the Flicker but are louder.</p>

<p>The nest is usually well up; the 3-5 white eggs are laid
in April in the south, in May in the north.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-HEADED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Melanerpes erythrocephalus. <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Figs. 21, 22; <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>,
Fig. 43</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adults of both sexes have the whole head red; young, during
their first winter, have the head grayish brown, and a black band
across the white wing-feathers. L. 9&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern United States, west to Rockies; local east of
the Alleghanies and north of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common S.R., rare W.V. Ossining, rare
P.R., common in fall, Aug. 27-Oct. 12. Cambridge, irregular
at all seasons; sometimes common in fall. N. Ohio, common
S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 25; occasionally winters. Glen Ellyn,
common S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 6; a few winter. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Apl. 4-Sept. 17; rare in winter.</p></div>

<p>Adding to the normal habits of a Woodpecker marked
skill as a flycatcher, the Red-head stops his grub-hunting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and swings out after a passing insect with a dazzling display
of red, white and blue-black. Noisy as he is conspicuous,
he beats his log-drum, rolls a tree toad-like
<i>krrring</i>, or, with tireless persistency utters a whistled
croak. In the northeastern states Red-heads are distributed
irregularly. They are rarely common in the
summer, but in the fall they sometimes appear in numbers.
Whenever they come we are soon aware of their
presence.</p>

<p>The nest is generally in a dead tree; the 4-6 white eggs
are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER<br />

<i>Centurus carolinus. <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 23</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Back and wings evenly barred with black and white, hence
the name 'Zebra'; the female and young have the front part
of the crown gray. L. 9&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern United States, north to southern Pennsylvania,
western New York and southern Minnesota; casually
further.</p>

<p>Washington, locally common P.R. Cambridge, A.V., one
record. N. Ohio, tolerably common P.R. SE. Minn., uncommon
P.R.</p></div>

<p>A common, hoarse-voiced resident of orange groves
and gardens who with a <i>chuh-chuh</i>, jerkily hitches himself
upward in the routine of the daily grub hunt. It is rare
at the northern part of its range, but resident wherever
found. The nest is in dead or living trees; the 4-6 white
eggs are laid in late April <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'of'">or</ins>  early May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />NORTHERN FLICKER<br />

<i>Colaptes auratus luteus. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 21, 22; <a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 20</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The white rump and yellow wing-linings, displayed in flight;
black breast-crescent, spotted underparts and fairly large size,

lacks the male's 'moustache.' L. 12.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America, from North Carolina and
southern Illinois to Canada and Alaska. The Southern Flicker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>

<p>Thirty years ago the Flicker, High-hole or Yellow-hammer,
was prey of any boy with a gun and was correspondingly
wild and little known; now, thanks to the
Audubon Society, he is almost as domestic as the Robin.
In search of ants and their eggs, he hunts our lawns and
even accepts the hospitality of our nest-logs. A great
acquisition to our dooryard life is this bird of beautiful
colors, quaint habits, and strange notes. His loud,
strongly accented call, <i>k&eacute;e-yer</i>, his rapidly repeated mellow
<i>we&eacute;chew, we&eacute;chew</i>, possess character even if they lack
musical quality.</p>

<p>The Flicker nests in holes and lays from 5-9 white eggs
in late April or early May.</p>

<p>What the Whip-poor-will is to the north the Chuckwill
is to the south. The difference in their names expresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the syllabic difference in their calls, but the Chuckwill's
notes are uttered more evenly and lack the marked accent
on the first "Whip" of its northern cousin's song.</p>

<p>The Chuckwill lays its two eggs in April on the ground

<p>A mysterious, silent, flitting shadow, should we chance
to arouse it from its sleep in the forest by day, at dusk the
Whip-poor-will takes the center of the stage and announces
his presence to the world. <i>Whip&#769;-poor-will, whip&#769;-poor-will</i>
he calls with a snap and a swinging rhythm that makes
the twilight ring with the oft-repeated notes.</p>

<p>Two eggs are laid on the ground in the woods in May.
They are dull white with delicate obscure lilac markings,
and a few brownish gray spots.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />NIGHTHAWK<br />

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America from the Gulf States and

<p>Doubtless because we see the Nighthawk and only hear
the Whip-poor-will the notes of the latter have been often
attributed to the former, with the result that many people
think there is but one species. While it is true that there
is a general resemblance in form, in details of color and
markings, the two birds are quite unlike, while so far as
notes and habits are concerned, few members of the
same family differ more. The Whip-poor-will haunts the
shadows of the woods and rarely flies far above the ground,
the Nighthawk, like a Swift, courses high in the open, even
over city house-tops, where anyone who looks may see
him. The Whip-poor-will's notes have made him famous,
the Nighthawk calls only a nasal <i>peent, peent</i>, and, diving
earthward on set wings, produces a hollow, booming
sound. Both nest on the ground, but the Nighthawk
lays in the fields or on pebbly roofs, and its two finely
marked eggs (laid in May or June) are quite unlike those
of the Whip-poor-will.</p>

<p>Any Hummingbird seen east of the Mississippi may, with
confidence, be called a Ruby-throat; exceptions will probably
prove to be sphinx moths, which, it must be confessed,
look singularly hummingbird-like as they hover
before flowers. When the eggs are laid the male deserts
the female, leaving to her the task of incubation and care
of the young.</p>

<p>A valiant defender of his home who, at the approach of
Crow or Hawk, utters his steely, chattering, battle-cry
and sallies forth to attack. Fearlessly he plunges down on
an enemy many times his size who dodging this way and
that beats a hasty retreat before his active, aggressive
assailant. In the fall migration Kingbirds gather in
loose flocks.</p>

<p>The nest is placed near the end of a branch about 20 feet

<p><i>Range.</i> West Indies, nesting north through Florida to southeastern

<p>A not uncommon summer resident in parts of Florida
and the coastal region of Georgia and South Carolina,

<p>A character of the woods distinguished alike by appearance,
voice and habits. His crested head seems too big
for his body; his exclamatory whistle, which sounds like
a shout above a monotone of conversation, his habit of
always lining his nest with a cast-off snake skin, all mark
him as an odd genius. Even his wife's eggs, with their
long chocolate streaks, are quite unlike any other birds'

<p>The Ph&oelig;be is the best known member of a group of small
Flycatchers which the beginner, and not infrequently the
advanced student, names with more or less uncertainty.
Fortunately for the field student, and as if to compensate
for their close resemblance in plumage, they all possess
distinctive, quite unlike, and easily recognizable calls, and
consequently can readily be identified by their voices if
not by their colors.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;be shows so marked a fondness for our society,
nesting under our piazzas, in barns or outbuildings, and
calls his <i>pewit-ph&oelig;be</i> so plainly, wagging his tail the while
in a friendly, sociable kind of a way, that there is never
any doubt about his identity; but we will not make the
acquaintance of his less common, less confiding relatives
so readily.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;be's 4-6 white eggs (rarely with a few brown

<p>To most of us the Olive-sided is known as a rare migrant
passing northward in May, among the later transients, and
southward in September. When traveling the bird retains
the fondness of its kind for perching on tall tree-tops, but
its loud, unmistakable, whistled "come right <i>here</i>, come
right <i>here</i>" is usually heard only on the nesting ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The nest is placed in coniferous trees about 25 feet up,
and 3-5 white, brown-spotted eggs are laid in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WOOD PEWEE<br />

<i>Myiochanes virens. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 63</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Resembles the Ph&oelig;be but is smaller with relatively longer wings
and more evident wing-bars. L. 6&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America; nesting from Florida to
Canada; winters in the tropics.</p>

29. SE. Minn., common S.R., May 10-Sept. 23.</p></div>

<p>In color Ph&oelig;be and Pewee are much alike and both are
Flycatchers, but the resemblance ends there. Pewee
loves the solitude of the forest rather than the sociability
of the barnyard, and his pensive <i>pee-a-wee</i> does not even
suggest the business-like <i>pewit-ph&oelig;be</i> of his better-known
cousin. Nor does his dainty lichen-covered nest saddled
so skillfully on the limb of a forest tree, recall the Ph&oelig;be's
bulky moss and mud dwelling. Finally, the Pewee's
eggs, laid in May, are wreathed with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER<br />

<i>Empidonax flaviventris. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>. Fig. 61</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The entire underparts, including the throat, are unquestionably
sulphur-yellow. L. 5&frac12;</p>

<p>Known chiefly as a not common migrant who visits
our woods on his journey to and from his northern home.
He is a silent traveler and gives no clue to his identity
by calling or singing, but his underparts are so much
yellower than those of any other of our small Flycatchers
that they make a definite field character. Nests in
coniferous forests on the ground, laying 4 white, lightly
spotted eggs in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ACADIAN FLYCATCHER<br />

<i>Empidonax virescens. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 60</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Throat white, upperparts bright, light olive-green, without
tinge of brown as in the Alder Flycatcher.</p>

Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 6-Aug. 27, and
probably later.</p></div>

<p>On the low-sweeping limb of a beech over a stream is an
ideal site for the frail nest of the Acadian. The bird is
never found far from it and its low-ranging habits permit
us to see its characteristic markings and hear its peculiar
sudden, explosive little <i>pee-e-y&uacute;k</i> and more commonly
uttered <i>spee</i> or <i>peet</i>.</p>

<p>The creamy white, brown-spotted eggs are laid the latter
part of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ALDER FLYCATCHER<br />

<i>Empidonax trailli alnorum. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 62</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Larger than the Least Flycatcher, but resembling it in having
the back olive-brown instead of olive-green as in the Acadian
and Yellow-bellied Flycatchers. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America; nests from northern New
Jersey (locally) and mountains of West Virginia to Canada;

Glen Ellyn, quite common S.R., May 14-Sept. 19. S.E.
Minn., common S.R., May 6-Aug. 10.</p></div>

<p>A rare recluse of the alders who, traveling silently
between his summer and his winter homes, makes few
friends among men. Dwight describes its call note as
"a single <i>pep</i>," and its song as <i>ee-zee-e-up</i>, resembling
that of the Acadian. The bird places the nest low down
in the crotch of one of the bushes among which it lives
and lays 3-4 white, brown-spotted eggs in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LEAST FLYCATCHER<br />

<i>Empidonax minimus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 44</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smallest of the Flycatchers; like the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Adler'">Alder</ins> Flycatcher its

<p>A Flycatcher of lawns and orchard, seldom going far
from the tree in which its nest with its white eggs is
placed. A dry-voiced little bird whose unmusical, but
distinctly uttered <i>cheb&eacute;c, cheb&eacute;c</i> makes up in character
what it lacks in sweetness. Between whiles he swings
out for a passing insect only to call <i>cheb&eacute;c, cheb&eacute;c, cheb&eacute;c</i>
when he returns to his perch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2>LARKS. FAMILY ALAUDID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PRAIRIE HORNED LARK<br />

<i>Otocoris alpestris praticola. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 42</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Note the long hind-toe nail (or the track it leaves), the little
feathered 'horns,' the black patch on cheeks and breast (less
evident in winter). Smaller than the Northern Horned Lark,
which visits the United States only in winter, with the line
over the eye white, and throat but faintly tinged with yellow.
L. 7&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests in the Upper Mississippi Valley from Missouri
and in the Atlantic States (locally), from Connecticut northward;
winters southward to Texas and Georgia. The Horned
Lark (<i>Otocoris alpestris alpestris</i>), is a more northern race, nesting
in the Arctic regions and migrating southward as far as Ohio and
rarely Georgia, when it is often associated with the resident
Prairie Horned Lark. It is larger than that race (L. 7&frac34;) and has
the throat and line over the eye yellow.</p>

<p>Washington, common W.V., Aug. 11-Apl. Cambridge, one
record. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R.
SE. Minn., S.R., Mch.-Nov., a few in mild winters.</p></div>

<p>A bird of open places&mdash;shores, plains, and prairies,
and roadways&mdash;who runs (not hops) nimbly ahead of one,
or, with a short note, rises, and on its long, pointed wings,
flies on ahead. He usually returns to the ground, but
may alight on a fence; his long hind toe-nail not being
suited to grasping a small perch. The weak, twittering
song is uttered on the wing, when the bird, like its relative
the Skylark, mounts into the air. It also sings from a
perch near the ground.</p>

<p>The Prairie Horned Lark is the first of our small birds to
nest, making its home on the ground and laying four
finely speckled eggs early in March. After the nesting
season the birds gather in flocks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<h2>CROWS, JAYS, ETC. FAMILY CORVID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUE JAY<br />

<i>Cyanocitta cristata cristata. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 20</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Color, habits and voice combine to render the Blue Jay conspicuous.
L. 11&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America from Georgia to Quebec;
migratory only at the northern limit of its range. The Florida
Blue Jay (<i>Cyanocitta cristata florincola</i>, <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 75) is smaller
(L. 10&frac34;) and grayer above. It is found throughout Florida.</p>

<p>Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V., Apl. 28-May 15;
Sept. 15-Oct. 15. Ossining, tolerably common P.R. Cambridge,
common P.R., abundant T.V., Apl. and May; Sept. and Oct.
N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn.,
common P.R.</p></div>

<p>If the Blue Jay were as good as he is beautiful he would
be our most popular bird. But fine feathers do not always
make fine birds, and to those who judge birds by human
standards the Blue Jay's loud, harsh voice, overbearing
manners, and nest-robbing habits are unpardonable.
With all his faults, however, the true bird enthusiast loves
him still. His bright colors, dashing ways and intelligence
win our admiration and we feel honored when he
makes his home near ours, building in early May a well-made
nest in a tree-crotch, for the reception of the 4-6
olive-green, thickly speckled eggs.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />FLORIDA JAY<br />

<i>Aphelocoma cyanea</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Size of the Blue Jay but quite unlike it in color. The head,
wings and tail are grayish blue without white markings; the
back is pale brown, the underparts dirty white, with the throat
inconspicuously streaked and a faint bluish breast-band.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Florida between lat. 27&deg; and 30&deg;, and chiefly along
the coasts.</p></div>

<p>This is the 'Scrub-Jay' of Florida and is not to be
confused with the Florida Blue Jay. It lives in districts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
where scrub palmetto grows, but also comes into
gardens and grows where it soon responds to proper treatment
and becomes semi-domesticated. It nests early in
April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CANADA JAY.<br />

<i>Perisoreus canadensis canadensis</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Size of the Blue Jay; a gray bird with a black crown and white
forehead, cheeks and throat.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Northern New England and northern New York,
northward; resident, rarely straggling southward.</p>

<p>Cambridge, A.V., one record, Oct.</p></div>

<p>It is singular that the Canada Jay at the north and
the Florida Jay in the south should show exceptional
confidence in man, while the Blue Jay always seems to
regard him with suspicion. The very day we make camp
in the north woods the Canada Jay or Whiskey Jack
becomes our guest. As though assured of a welcome he
fearlessly joins our party, helping himself to such supplies
as please his fancy. Long before our arrival, when snow
still covered the ground, he has reared his family and for
the rest of the year has only his own wants to fill.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RAVEN<br />

<i>Corvus corax principalis</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Much larger than the Crow, the throat with long, pointed
feathers, instead of short, rounded ones. L. 24.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America rare and local in the Eastern States,
south to New Jersey on the coast and to Georgia in the mountains.</p></div>

<p>Crows <i>caw</i>, while Ravens <i>croak;</i> but to be sure that you
have actually seen a Raven he should be with Crows, when
the Raven's much larger size is evident. Unless, however,
you should visit the few localities in the eastern States
where Ravens live you are not likely to make the bird's
acquaintance. Ravens nest on cliffs as well as in trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Their eggs, which resemble those of the Crow in color,
are laid in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CROW<br />

<i>Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos. <a href="#Case_1">Case 1</a>, Fig. 19;
<a href="#Case_3">Case 3</a>, Fig. 27</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sexes alike in color. L. 19&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America; migratory at the northern limit of
its range; roosting in colonies in winter.</p>

<p>Washington, abundant P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge,

<p>The Crow and the Robin are probably the best known
of all our birds. The former we treat as an enemy and the
latter as a friend, and one therefore is as wild as the other
is tame. Whether the Crow deserves to be outlawed has
not as yet been decided. But we should not condemn him
out of court and let us remember that as an intelligent,
self-respecting citizen, who animates wintry wastes with
his shining sable form and clarion call, he has other than
economic claims to our consideration. The nest is placed
in a tree about 30 feet up, and 4-6 eggs, green thickly
marked with brownish are laid in April.</p>

<p>The Florida Crow (<i>C. b. pascuus</i>) is very near the
northern bird, but has the wings and tail smaller, the bill
and feet larger. It lives chiefly in the pine barrens of
Florida and is much less common in the state than the
Fish Crow.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />FISH CROW<br />

<i>Corvus ossifragus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Brighter, more uniformly colored above and below, the feathers
without dull tips.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Atlantic and Gulf coast region from the lower Hudson
Valley and Long Island Sound southward. Migratory only at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the northern limit of its range. Found throughout Florida, but
elsewhere usually not far from tidal water.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common P.R. Cambridge, A.V., one
record, Mch.</p></div>

<p>In life the Fish Crow may be distinguished from the
common Crow by its smaller size and hoarser voice. The
difference in size, however, is evident only when the two
are together, but once the cracked, reedy <i>car</i> (not <i>caw</i>) of
the Fish Crow has been learned the species may always
be identified when heard. It is somewhat like the note
of a young Crow, but less immature. The nest and eggs
are much like those of the common Crow. The eggs are
laid in May.</p>

<h2>STARLINGS. FAMILY STURNID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />STARLING<br />

<i>Sturnus vulgaris. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 24, 25</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In winter conspicuously dotted with whitish; in summer with
but few dots and a yellow bill; at all times with a short tail and
long wings. L 8&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Introduced from Europe into Central Park, New York
City, in 1890, now more or less numerous from Virginia to Maine;
occasional west of the Alleghanies. It is a quick, active bird,
probing the ground now this side, now that, as it walks rapidly
over our lawns. The short tail and long wings are most noticeable
in the air and distinguish the Starling from our other black
birds.</p></div>

<p>A long-drawn whistle, such as one calls to a dog, is the
Starling's most common note, but it has many others.
It nests in April, often after quarreling with Flickers for
possession of a nest-hole in which to lay its pale bluish
eggs. The young appear in mid-May and their harsh,
rasping food-call is a common note for several weeks;
then the birds begin to gather in companies which, later,
form flocks of thousands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2>BLACKBIRDS, ORIOLES, ETC. FAMILY ICTERID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BOBOLINK<br />

<i>Dolichonyx oryzivorus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 13, 14</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In July, after nesting, the male molts into a plumage resembling
that of the female, when both are known as Reedbird. L 7&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New Jersey and northern Missouri
to southern Canada and westward to British Columbia;
leaves the United States through Florida and winters chiefly in
northwestern Argentina; returns to United States early in
April.</p>

Ellyn, S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 9. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 5-Aug.
27.</p></div>

<p>A bird with a dual personality; welcome minstrel of
the meadows when nesting, dread scourge of the rice-fields
when traveling. With the loss of his trim suit of
black, white, and buff, Bob loses also his merry tinkling,
rippling song, and acquires with his streaked Reedbird
suit a single watchword. <i>Tink, tink</i> he calls from somewhere
overhead, and <i>tink, tink</i> his comrades answer as they
follow a trackless path through the sky on their 5000-mile
journey.</p>

<p>The nest is placed on the ground and 4-7 grayish,
blotched eggs are laid late in May or early in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />COWBIRD<br />

<i>Molothrus ater ater. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Figs. 8, 9</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male's brown head distinguishes him from other Blackbirds;
the female wears a dull gray garb well designed to make
her inconspicuous. L. 8.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America; nesting from North Carolina and
Louisiana to Canada; winters from Virginia and Ohio southward.</p>

<p>Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V. Ossining, common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

10. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 11-Aug. 19.</p></div>

<p>Outlaws among birds, they pair not neither do they
build. Without moral standards or maternal instincts the
female accepts the attention of any male that chances to
win her fancy and deposits her eggs in the nests of other
birds. She is a slacker and a shirker, who keeps much
in the background during the breeding season. Color,
habit, his sliding, glassy whistle, and guttural gurgling,
make the male conspicuous. Leaving the care of their
foster parents the young join others of their kind and
flock in the grainfields or about cattle in the pastures.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD<br />

<i>Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 45</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Large size and a yellow head distinguish the male; the female
is duller, the body brownish, the head yellowish. L. 10.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Mississippi Valley and westward, breeding from northern
Illinois northward to Canada; winters from the west Gulf
coast and southern California into Mexico; accidental east of the
Alleghanies.</p>

<p>Washington, A.V., one instance, Aug. Cambridge, A.V., one
record, Oct. Glen Ellyn, A.V., May 21, 1898. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Apl. 21.</p></div>

<p>Hanging their cradle nest in the quill-reeds or rushes,
the Yellow-heads are not found far from it until the young
take wing. The male entertains his mate with a variety
of strange calls and whistles, but leaves to her the hatching
of the brown speckled eggs and care of the young while
they are in the nest. Like other Blackbirds they migrate
and winter in flocks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD<br />

<i>Agelaius ph&oelig;niceus ph&oelig;niceus. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Figs. 5, 6</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male in spring and early summer is unmistakable; in
winter his feathers are tipped with brownish, more pronounced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in the young. The streaked females require closer scrutiny.
L. 9&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America, nests from Florida to Canada;
winters from Maryland southward, sometimes farther north.
The Florida Red-wing (<i>A. p. floridanus</i>, <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Figs. 28, 29) is
smaller and with a slenderer bill. It inhabits Florida (except
the southeast coast and Keys) and ranges west along the Gulf
coast to Texas. The Bahama Red-wing (<i>A. p. bahamensis</i>) is
still smaller. It is resident in southeastern Florida, the Keys
and Bahamas.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R., abundant in migration. Ossining,
common S.R., Feb. 25-Nov. 11. Cambridge, abundant
S.R., Mch. 10-Aug. 30; a few winter. N. Ohio, abundant S.R.,
Mch. 1-Nov. 15. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 19.
SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 8-Nov. 14.</p></div>

<p>The Red-wing's mellow <i>kong-quer-reee</i> is as certain an
indication of the presence of water as is the piping of frogs
in the spring. It may be only a bit of boggy marshland,
it may be a reedy lakeside, but water there will surely be.
On a frequented perch he half spreads his wings, fluffs
out his scarlet epaulets, bursting into bloom, as it were,
when he utters his notes&mdash;a singing flower! The nest
is in the alders, button-bushes, or reeds, or even on the
ground, and although the birds come in March, their
pale blue, spotted, blotched, and scrawled eggs are not
laid until May. Except when nesting, Red-wings live in
flocks.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MEADOWLARK<br />

<i>Sturnella magna magna. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 23</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large, quail-like bird which shows white outer tail-feathers
when it flies; if one can obtain a front view, the yellow underparts
and black breast-crescent are conspicuous. L. 10&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America, rare west of the Mississippi;
nesting from North Carolina and Missouri to Canada; winters
from southern New England and northern Ohio southward.
The Southern Meadowlark (<i>S. m. argutula</i>, <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 79) is
smaller and darker. It is resident in the south Atlantic and
Gulf States.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R., less common in winter. Ossining,

Jan. 24-Nov. 15; irregular W.V. SE. Minn., common S.R.,
Mch. 25-Oct. 15; rare W.V.</p></div>

<p>The Meadowlark is a fifer of the fields, whose high, clear
whistle is one of the most welcome bird songs of early
spring. In May, when nesting, it often sings an ecstatic
twittering warble on the wing. The alarm calls are an
unmusical <i>dzit</i> or <i>yert</i> and a string of beady, metallic notes.</p>

<p>The nest is placed on the ground. The 4-6 eggs are
white, speckled with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WESTERN MEADOWLARK<br />

<i>Sturnella neglecta</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Grayer than the Eastern Meadowlark, with disconnected
tail-bars and yellow spreading to the sides of the throat.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Western United States, rare east of the Mississippi.
SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct. 15.</p></div>

<p>With the general appearance and habits of the Eastern
Meadowlark, but differing in its call-notes and song.
Instead of the sharp <i>dzit</i> or <i>yert</i> and metallic twitter of the
eastern bird, the western species calls <i>chuck</i>, <i>chuck</i>, followed
by a rolling <i>b-r-r-r-</i>. The eastern bird plays the
fife but the western uses the flute, and its bubbling grace-notes

<div class='center'><br /><br />ORCHARD ORIOLE<br />

<i>Icterus spurius. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 10-12</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adult males are unmistakable, but females and young males
in their first fall wear a non-committal costume and must be
looked at sharply. In their first nesting season, young males
resemble the female but have a black throat. This is a smaller,
more slender bird than the Baltimore Oriole, and the female is
less orange. L. 7&frac14;.</p>

<p>In the northern part of its range, the Orchard Oriole is
somewhat less common, and more local than the Baltimore
Oriole, while its duller colors and more retiring habits make
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'it'">is</ins>  more difficult to see. The voice is richer, more cultured&mdash;if
one may use the term&mdash;than that of its brilliant
orange-plumed cousin; indeed, in my opinion, this species
deserves a place in the first rank of our songsters. The
nest of finely woven grasses is not so deep as that of
the Baltimore. Three to five bluish white eggs, spotted
and scrawled with black, are laid the latter part of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BALTIMORE ORIOLE<br />

<i>Icterus galbula. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 8, 9</i></div>

<p>This is the orange-and-black whistler of our fruit and
shade trees, whose wife skillfully weaves a pendant cradle at
the end of some drooping branch, therein to lay her white
eggs curiously marked with fine lines and blotches of
black. The young, after leaving the nest in June, have a
loud, babyish food-call, <i>dee-dee-dee-dee</i>, repeated time
after time until their wants are satisfied.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RUSTY BLACKBIRD<br />

<i>Euphagus carolinus. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Figs. 3, 4</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The bird's common name is based on the fall plumage of the

<p>This is the least conspicuous of our Blackbirds. It nests
chiefly north of the United States, migrates in small flocks,
and is less noisy than the Red-wing or Grackle and not
so much in evidence as the Cowbird. Dwight describes
its notes as "a confused medley of whistles, sweeter and
higher-pitched than those of the Red-wing." It nests
in May, building in coniferous trees or near the ground,
and laying 4-7 greenish eggs, heavily marked with brown
and purple.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PURPLE GRACKLE<br />

<i>Quiscalus quiscula quiscula. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 1</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Plumage varied with metallic and iridescent reflections; tail

<p>The Florida Grackle (<i>Quiscalus quiscula agl&aelig;us</i>, <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 74) is smaller than the Purple Grackle and has
the head and neck violet-purple, the back bottle-green.
It is resident in Florida and the Gulf States north to South
Carolina.</p>

<p>The Bronzed Grackle (<i>Quiscalus quiscula &oelig;neus</i>, <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 2) is the same size as the Purple Grackle, but has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the body bronzy without iridescent markings. It nests
from Texas up the Mississippi Valley and eastward through
central New York and Massachusetts to New Brunswick,
north to Canada; and in migration is found in the range
of the Purple Grackle. It winters from the Ohio Valley
southward.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Washington, rare T.V., Feb 20-Apl. 17. Ossining, common

<p>The Grackle is the largest of our northern Blackbirds.
In the south it is exceeded in size only by the Boat-tailed
Grackle. It migrates in flocks and nests in colonies,
often in parks and cemeteries. It feeds chiefly on the
ground and is frequently seen upon our lawns when it
may be known by its rather waddling, walking gait, and
its long tail. Its notes are harsh, cracked and discordant,
but when heard in chorus make a pleasing medley. The
nest is sometimes placed in pines about 30 feet up,
but also in bushes and even in holes in trees. The 3-7
eggs are usually pale bluish, heavily blotched and scrawled
with brown and black.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE<br />

<i>Megaquiscalus major major</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male is a long-tailed, glossy blue-black bird. (L. 16.)
The female is much smaller (L. 12), blackish brown above, buff

<p><i>Range.</i> Florida north on the Atlantic coast to Virginia; west
to Texas.</p></div>

<p>This giant Grackle frequents lakes, lagoons and bays,
where it feeds along the shore or among aquatic plants.
The male, a poseur among birds, strikes strange attitudes
with bill pointing skyward, and with apparent effort
forces out hoarse whistles. The female is quiet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
unassuming. They nest in colonies, building in bushes and
laying in April 3-5 bluish white eggs, strikingly blotched
and scrawled with blackish.</p>

<span class="caption">Evening Grosbeak.<br />
Male and Female.</span>
</div>

<p>The Evening Grosbeak is a notable traveler from the
far northwest whose rare, irregular, and unheralded visits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and striking appearance make him always a welcome and
distinguished guest. Of recent years these birds have come
to the east with greater frequency, arriving in November
and remaining as late as May. They feed largely on the
buds and seeds of trees&mdash;maple and box-elder&mdash;and can
often be attracted to our feeding-stations by the offer of
sunflower seeds. They are usually associated in flocks
of from six to eight to ten birds, and their notes when
perching, have been described as resembling the jingle of
small sleigh-bells, while their song is said to be a "wandering
jerky warble."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PINE GROSBEAK<br />

<i>Pinicola enucleator leucura. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 53, 54</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adult males are unmistakable; but young males and female
might be confused with the female Evening Grosbeak, but they
lack the conspicuous white markings in the wings and tail of that
species. L. 9.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Northern North America, wintering southward
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'irreguarly'">irregularly</ins>  to Indiana and New Jersey; rarely as far as Kentucky
and Washington.</p>

<p>Washington, casual in winter. Ossining, irregular W.V.,

sometimes abundant, Nov. 1-Mch. 25. N. Ohio, occasional
W.V. Glen Ellyn, uncommon and irregular W.V., Oct. 25-?
SE. Minn., uncommon W.V.</p></div>

<p>In the summer the Pines Grosbeak lives in coniferous
forests, but on its irregular wanderings southward, like
the Evening Grosbeak, it feeds upon the seeds of deciduous
trees and bushes. The Grosbeak's call-note is a clear
whistle of three or four notes which may be easily imitated;
its song is said to be prolonged and melodious.</p>

<p>The Pine and Evening Grosbeaks would be notable
figures in any gathering of birds, but coming at the most
barren time of the year when our bird population is at the
minimum and the trees are leafless, they are as welcome as
they are conspicuous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PURPLE FINCH<br />

<i>Carpodacus purpureus purpureus. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 32, 33; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>,
Figs. 48, 49</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adult male is dull rose rather than purple, the female is
sparrow-like in appearance but may be known by a whitish line
over the eye and the company she keeps. Young males resemble
their mother their first winter. L. 6&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern North America; nesting from northern
Illinois and northern New Jersey northward to Canada; winters

<p>Erratic wanderers which travel on no fixed schedule
but seem to feel at home wherever they find themselves.
Except when nesting, they usually live in small
flocks which, if the fare of our feeding-stands please
them, will sometimes live with us for weeks. The call-note
is <i>creak-creak</i>, the song a flowing, musical warble
often uttered in detached fragments. Four to six bluish,
spotted eggs are laid in May; the nest being generally
built in a coniferous tree.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ENGLISH SPARROW; HOUSE SPARROW<br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Unfortunately too well known to require description. L. 6&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> First introduced into this country at Brooklyn, N.Y.,
from Europe in 1851; now found everywhere at all times.</p></div>

<p>Hardy, pugnacious and adaptable, the Sparrow is a
notable success in the bird world. We could overlook his
objectionable traits if he possessed a pleasant voice, but
his harsh, discordant notes and incessant chatter are
unfortunately in harmony with his character. After all
he gives a welcome touch of life to city streets and yards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Sparrows' nests are made of almost anything the birds
can carry and built in any place that will hold them.
The 4-7 finely speckled eggs are laid as early as March,
and several broods are raised.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />AMERICAN CROSSBILL<br />

<i>Loxia curvirostra minor. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a> Figs. 49, 50</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Crossbills have the mandibles crossed; the absence of wing-bars
distinguishes this species from the usually less common
White-winged Crossbill. L. 6&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England to Canada and
southward in the Alleghanies to northern Georgia. Winters irregularly
southward, rarely as far as Florida and Louisiana.</p>

<p>Washington, irregular W.V., sometimes abundant. Ossining,
irregular; noted in almost every month. Cambridge, of common
but irregular occurrence at all seasons. N. Ohio, irregular,
often common, sometimes breeds. Glen Ellyn, uncommon
and irregular, Oct. 20-June 11. SE. Minn., W.V., Oct. 25.</p></div>

<p>Crossbills and Grosbeaks are among winter's chief
attractions. While the latter, as I have said above, will
leave their summer homes in coniferous forests to feed in
winter on the seeds of deciduous trees, the Crossbills
are less adaptable. They are specialists in cone-dissecting.
Their singularly shaped bills prevent them from eating
many kinds of food available to other birds, but no other
birds can compete with them in extracting the seeds from
cones. Having had too limited an experience with man
to have learned to fear him, they are so surprisingly tame
that I have known birds to be plucked from trees as one
would pick off the cones on which they were feeding. In
March, while the ground is still snow-covered, they lay
3-4 pale greenish, spotted eggs in a well-formed nest,
15-30 feet up in a coniferous tree.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-WINGED CROSSBILL<br />

<i>Loxia leucoptera. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 51, 52</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Both sexes have white wing-bars and the male is of a paler,
more rosy red than the male of the American Crossbill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England to Canada; winters
irregularly to southern Illinois and North Carolina.</p>

<p>Washington, casual. Ossining, rare T.V., Oct. 29-Dec. 6,
Cambridge, irregular W.V. N. Ohio, rare W.V. Glen Ellyn,
rare, fall records only, Nov. SE. Minn., W.V., latest record
Mch. 4.</p></div>

<p>A rarer bird than the American Crossbill which, however,
it resembles in habits. Both climb about the branches of
cone-bearing trees like little Parrots, while feeding keep
up a low conversational chatter, and take wing with a
clicking note. They have been found nesting in Nova
Scotia as early as February 6.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />REDPOLL<br />

<i>Acanthis linaria linaria. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>. Figs. 47, 48</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Any little sparrow-like bird with a red cap is a Redpoll. Adult

<p>A winter visitor from the far North whose coming
never can be foretold. Years may pass without seeing
them, then late some fall, they may appear in numbers.
They are usually in flocks and feed upon seeds as well as
birch and alder catkins. In notes and general habits the
Redpoll resembles the Goldfinch.</p>

<p>Holb&oelig;ll's Redpoll (<i>A. holb&oelig;lli</i>) is a slightly larger race,
with a longer, more slender bill. It is a more northern
form than the preceding, and rarely visits the United
States. The Greater Redpoll (<i>A. l. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'rostreta'">rostrata</ins> </i>) is also larger
than the common Redpoll, but has a shorter, stouter
bill. It nests in Greenland and is of casual occurrence in
the northern United States. The Hoary Redpoll (<i>A.
hornemanni exilipes</i>) is a whiter bird than the preceding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
with no streaks on the rump and comparatively few on the
underparts. It nests within the Arctic Circle and rarely
visits the northern United States in winter.</p>

<p>Satisfactory identification of these races of the Redpoll
can be made only by expert examination of specimens.
The field student, however, may call any Redpoll he sees
the Common Redpoll with the chances of being right
largely in his favor.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GOLDFINCH<br />

<i>Astragalinus tristis tristis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>. Figs. 35, 36; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Figs.
50, 51</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While he wears his 'Goldfinch' costume, the male will be known
at a glance, but in winter, when he takes the dull yellow-olive
dress of his mate, several glances may be required to recognize
him, and this remark, of course, applies to the female at all
seasons. L. 5.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America; the eastern form nests from Arkansas
and northern Georgia to Canada and winters from the Northern
to the Gulf States.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R. Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge,
very common P.R. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen
Ellyn, common P.R. SE. Minn., P.R., common in summer,
uncommon in winter.</p></div>

<p>A beautiful, musical, cheerful bird, as sweet of disposition
as he is of voice. To hear a merry troop of Goldfinches
singing their spring chorus is to hear the very
spirit of the season set to music. Their call-note is a
questioning <i>dearie, dearie</i>, their flight-call <i>per-chi&eacute;-o-ree,
per-chi&eacute;-o-ree</i>, as in long undulations they swing through
the air. Their song is suggestive of a Canary's. They
are late housekeepers, not nesting before the latter half
of June, when 3-6 pale bluish white eggs are laid in a nest
warmly lined with plant down.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PINE SISKIN<br />

<i>Spinus pinus pinus. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>. Fig. 55</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A streaked, sparrow-like bird, with yellow markings in wings
and tail which show in flight. L. 5.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i> North America; nests from northern New England

<p>The Siskin belongs in the group of winter visitants
whose coming cannot be foretold. Some years it is rare
or wanting, others abundant, a flock sometimes, containing
several hundred birds. In general habits it resembles
the Goldfinch, feeding on weed seeds and catkins, particularly
of the alder, and on the seeds of conifers. The
call-note is a high <i>e-eep;</i> its song like that of the Goldfinch
but less musical.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SNOW BUNTING<br />

<i>Plectrophanes nivalis nivalis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 57</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The prevailing tone of plumage is white, particularly when the

<p>Snow Buntings live in flocks and love open places, such
as Horned Larks frequent, and are often found with them
in fields or along the shore. Like the Horned Larks they
are walkers, not hoppers, and like most walkers, it is
exceptional for them to perch in trees. Hoffman described
their notes as "a high, sweet, though slightly
mournful <i>tee</i>, or <i>tee-oo</i>, a sweet rolling whistle, and a harsh
<i>bzz</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>A rare visitor from the far North who, if we see it at all
will probably be found in the company of Horned Larks
or Snow Buntings. It is a browner bird than either of
them, so while this is not a case of 'birds of a feather'
it <i>is</i> a case of birds of a long hind toe-nail, since all three
are distinguished by having a toe-nail actually longer than
its toe. All three are walkers, which means also that
they are ground-birds rather than tree-birds, and the
tracks they leave in the snow, or on the beach, distinguish
them from other birds if not from each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>A Sparrow of broad fields and plains whose song voices
the spirit of open places. Neither words nor musical
notation can describe it recognizably. It has somewhat
the form of the Song Sparrow's song, just as the two birds
resemble each other in form but are unlike in detail.
One must, therefore, first learn to know the bird&mdash;an
easy matter, since it is common and can be readily identified
by its white outer tail-feathers&mdash;and thereafter you
will be the richer for a knowledge of this rarely appealing
bit of bird music.</p>

<p>The nest, as one might suppose, is built on the ground,
and the 4-5 whitish spotted eggs are laid early in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />IPSWICH SPARROW<br />

<p>Few migratory birds have a more restricted breeding

island during the summer where it is never out of
sight or sound of the sea, it seeks similar haunts during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the winter when it is rarely found far from the immediate
vicinity of the ocean. In general habits and nesting,
it resembles the Savannah Sparrow, of which indeed,
it is doubtless an island representative.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SAVANNAH SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerculus sandwichensis savanna. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 47; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>,
Fig. 23</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In general color slightly paler than the Vesper Sparrow;
smaller than that species; no white tail-feathers; a touch of
yellow before the eye and on the bend of the wing. L. 5&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Long Island and northern Iowa to Canada;
winters from southern New Jersey and southern Indiana southward
to Mexico.</p>

<p>Washington, abundant T.V., Mch. 20-May 11; Sept. 21-Oct.
23; a few winter. Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 3-May 13;

Glen Ellyn, fairly plentiful S.R., Apl. 8-Oct. 20. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 23.</p></div>

<p>An abundant Sparrow known only to bird students. It
prefers fields to door-yards; lives much on the ground,
and its darting flight, followed by a sudden dive to cover,
and insignificant song all combine to make it rather difficult
of identification. It nests in May, laying 4-5 white,
speckled eggs in a nest on the ground.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GRASSHOPPER SPARROW<br />

<i>Ammodramus savannarum australis. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 16</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A small, short-tailed Sparrow, without streaks on the underparts
and a back pattern which suggests 'feather scales.' L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Eastern United States, nesting as far north as southern
Minnesota, and southern New Hampshire; winters from southern
Illinois and North Carolina to the tropics. The Florida Grasshopper
Sparrow (<i>A. s. floridanus</i>) a smaller, darker race, is resident
in the Kissimmee prairies of south central Florida.</p>

<p>Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 17-Nov. 20. Ossining
common S.R., Apl. 27-Oct. 23. Cambridge, rare S.R., May 16-Sept.

Apl. 25-Sept. 6.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Grasshopper, he is called, because his unmusical little
song, <i>pit-t&uacute;ck, zee-e-e-e-e</i>, sung from a low perch, resembles
the sound produced by that insect. He is a common
inhabitant of old fields, where sorrel and daisies grow,
and when flushed at one's feet darts away to drop suddenly
to the ground beyond. The 4-5, white, spotted
eggs are laid in a ground nest in late May or early June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />HENSLOW'S SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerherbulus henslowi henslowi. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 17</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With the general proportions of the Grasshopper Sparrow, but
the underparts distinctly streaked and the nape olive. L. 5.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from southern Missouri and Virginia to central
Minnesota and New Hampshire; winters in the Southern States.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 21. Ossining, rare
T.V., Oct. 5-Oct. 10. Cambridge, very rare S.R. N. Ohio,
S.R., Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 8-Sept. 26. SE.
Minn., common S.R.</p></div>

<p>Henslow's Sparrow lives in isolated and sometimes
widely separated communities, frequenting wet meadows
in summer, but visiting, also, dry fields in winter. It
has the general habits of the Grasshopper Sparrow and its
notes are equally unmusical. The 4-5 grayish white,
thickly speckled eggs are laid in a ground nest the latter
half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LECONTE'S SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerherbulus lecontei. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 18</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The underparts are but slightly streaked, the crown is striped,
and the nape reddish brown. L. 5.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nesting in the interior of North America from our
border States, northward and east to Minnesota; migrates southward
and south-eastward, and winters locally from South Carolina
to Florida and Texas.</p>

<p>Glen Ellyn, not common T.V., May 4-?; Sept. 8-Oct. 6. SE.
Minn, uncommon S.R., May 1-Oct. 17.</p></div>

<p>This is the third and rarest member of the trio of small,
retiring Sparrows of which the Grasshopper Sparrow is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
commonest. It is found east of the Mississippi only in the
winter when it may be associated with the Grasshopper
and Henslow's Sparrows.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SHARP-TAILED SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerherbulus caudacutus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 47</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A buffy Sparrow with the underparts sharply streaked with
black. L. 5&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Salt marshes of the Atlantic coast; nests from Virginia
to Massachusetts; winters from New Jersey to Florida.</p>

<p>Cambridge, formerly common S.R., but occurs no longer.</p></div>

<p>An abundant inhabitant of salt marshes. There is, or
was, a colony on the Hudson River immediately south of
the long pier from which Piermont takes its name, but
with this exception I have never seen this Sparrow beyond
the sound of the surf. It runs about through the thick
marsh grasses taking wing only when hard pressed. Its
song is short and insignificant. It nests on the ground,
the 3-4 grayish white, finely speckled eggs being laid
in late May or early June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />NELSON'S SHARP-TAILED SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerherbulus nelsoni nelsoni</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Resembles the Sharp-tailed but is smaller and has the throat,
breast and sides deeper, very slightly, if at all, streaked with
blackish; the upperparts more broadly margined with whitish.
L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests in the interior from South Dakota northward to
Great Slave Lake; migrates south to Texas and southeast through
New York and Massachusetts to North Carolina and Florida.</p>

<p>Washington, rare T.V., May-Sept. Ossining, tolerably common
T.V., Sept. 28-Oct. 17. Cambridge, formerly uncommon
T.V. Glen Ellyn, one record, Oct. 2, 1893. SE. Minn., uncommon
T.V.</p></div>

<p>This is a fresh-water representative of the Sharp-tail
which nests in the prairie sloughs of the interior and reaches
the Atlantic coast during its migrations and in the winter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
It resembles the Sharp-tail in habits and when on the coast,
may be found associated with it.</p>

<p>The Acadian Sharp-tailed Sparrow (<i>P. n. subvirgatus</i>)
is similar to the Sharp-tailed Sparrow but is paler above;
the throat, breast and sides are washed with cream-buff
and indistinctly streaked with ashy. It nests on the
salt marshes of the Atlantic coast from Maine to Cape
Breton and in Prince Edward Island; and winters from
South Carolina to Florida. In general habits it resembles
the two preceding.</p>

<p>The three Sharp-tails may be distinguished chiefly by
the color and markings of the breast. In the Sharp-tail
these are <i>pale</i> buff <i>distinctly</i> streaked with blackish. In
Nelson's they are <i>deep</i> buff lightly if at all streaked. In
the Acadian they are cream-buff indistinctly streaked
with <i>grayish</i>. The Sharp-tail may be known from the
other two by its distinct black marks below, but the other
two cannot certainly be distinguished from each other in
life where both may be expected to occur.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SEASIDE SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerherbulus maritimus maritimus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 46</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An olive-greenish Sparrow, with a yellow mark before the eye
and on the bend of the wing; the underparts <i>not</i> distinctly
streaked. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Salt marshes of the Atlantic Coast; nests from Virginia
to Massachusetts; winters from Virginia to Georgia.</p></div>

<p>In the Piermont marsh, referred to under the Sharp-tailed
Sparrow, there are Seasides as well as Sharp-tails,
but this is the only place in which I have seen Seasides
away from the sea. There they are abundant in the
grassy marshes. Their song is weak and unattractive.
Like the Sharp-tail they nest on the ground, laying 3-4
white or bluish white eggs, clouded or finely speckled
with cinnamon-brown, the latter part of May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>This northern Seaside Finch is migratory, coming the
latter part of April and remaining until the latter half
of October, but in the South there are several races which
for the most part are resident in the same locality throughout
the year. Thus we have:</p>

<p>Macgillivray's Seaside Sparrow (<i>P. m. macgillivraii</i>).&mdash;Atlantic
Coast from North Carolina south to Matanzas
Islet, Florida. Dusky Seaside Sparrow (<i>P. nigrescens</i>),
an almost black species from Merritt's Island, at the head
of Indian River, Florida. Cape Sable Sparrow (<i>P. m.
mirabilis</i>), Cape Sable, Florida. Scott's Seaside Sparrow
(<i>P. m. peninsul&aelig;</i>), Gulf Coast of Florida from Tampa to
St. Marks; Northwest Florida Sparrow (<i>P. m. juncicola</i>)
Coast of Florida west of St. Marks; Alabama Seaside
Sparrow (<i>P. m. howelli</i>), Coast of Alabama and Mississippi.
Louisiana Seaside Sparrow (<i>P. m. fisheri</i>),
Coast of Louisiana to Northeast Texas; and Sennett's
Seaside Sparrow (<i>P. m. sennetti</i>), Coast of Texas from
Galveston at least to Corpus Christi.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LARK SPARROW<br />

<i>Chondestes grammacus grammacus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 19</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The chestnut and white head markings and the white-tipped
tail-feathers are conspicuous field-marks. L. 6&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Mississippi Valley; nests from Louisiana to Minnesota
and Ohio; winters from Mississippi southward; casual
east of the Alleghanies, chiefly in the fall.</p>

<p>Washington, A.V., Aug., two captures. N. Ohio, rare S.R.,
Apl. 28. Glen Ellyn, local and uncommon S.R. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 2.</p></div>

<p>Few field experiences have given me more pleasure than
the discovery near my home at Englewood one November
2, many years ago, of a Lark Finch&mdash;one of the 'casuals'
which had presumably been carried far from its course
by a severe storm of the preceding days. The bird's
strongly marked face and conspicuously white-tipped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tail-feathers made an impression which testifies to their
value as field-characters. In its own range this beautiful
Sparrow is a sweet-voiced inhabitant of the fields, nesting
on the ground or in low trees and bushes, and laying 3-5
white eggs, spotted and blotched with blackish, in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />HARRIS'S SPARROW<br />

<i>Zonotrichia querula. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 21</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large Sparrow, larger even than the Fox Sparrow; with a
pinkish bill, the crown, throat and breast more or less blackish;
cheeks buff. L. 7&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Interior of North America, nesting in North Carolina;
winters from Kansas to Texas; rare east of Wisconsin. Glen
Ellyn, one record, May 19. SE. Minn., common T.V., May 6;
Sept. 21-Oct. 25.</p></div>

<p>When migrating this Sparrow reminds one of a White-throat.
It has a sharp <i>clink</i> note and frequents brier
patches and bushy places.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-CROWNED SPARROW<br />

<i>Zonotrichia leucophrys. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 22</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Resembles the White-throat but throat gray, like the breast,
space before the eye black, not yellow, white in the crown more
conspicuous. L. 6&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests in Canada; winters from Virginia and Ohio
to Mexico; not a common migrant in the Atlantic States.</p>

<p>Washington, irregularly common W.V. and T.V., May 1-17;
Oct. 7-Nov. 20. Ossining, rare T.V., May 9-26; Oct. 3-30.

SE. Minn., common T.V., Apl. 30-; Sept. 26-Oct. 14.</p></div>

<p>This distinguished-looking cousin of our White-throated
Sparrow is rare enough in the Eastern States, always to
command our attention when we are so fortunate as to
meet him. He resembles the White-throat in habits
and choice of haunts but his song has a tender, appealing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
quality, lacking in the White-throat's more cheerful lay,
charming as that is.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-THROATED SPARROW<br />

<i>Zonotrichia albicollis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>. Figs. 45, 46; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 40</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adults may be recognized at sight by their white throat,
but this character is less prominent and sometimes almost wanting
in young birds (Fig. 46) which will require close scrutiny. L. 6&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England and central Minnesota
northward; winters from southern New England and
Ohio to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Washington, very common W.V., abundant T.V., Mch. 18-May;

<p>This clear-voiced whistler is known to many persons
who have never seen it. When anyone returning from the
bird's summer range tells me "I heard a bird sing like
this," I know before he whistles a note that he will
probably imitate the White-throat. Fortunately the song
has so much character and its intervals conform so closely
to those of our musical scale, that a recognizable imitation
of it is within the power of everyone. There is much
variation in the arrangement of the notes and migrants
never seem to sing with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'th'">the</ins>  power of nesting birds, nor
do fall songs compare in volume or execution with those
of spring. The call-note is a characteristic sharp <i>clink</i>.</p>

<p>The White-throat is abundant, migrating and wintering
in companies which frequent bushy places, hedgerows
and undergrowth generally. The nest is placed on
the ground or in bushes in late May or early June. The
eggs. 4-5 in number, are bluish white, speckled or blotched
with brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />TREE SPARROW<br />

<i>Spizella monticola monticola. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 44; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 46</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A dusky spot in the center of the breast and a reddish brown
cap and streak behind the eye are distinguishing characters.
L. 6&frac12;.</p>

<p>From October to April companies of Tree Sparrows
harvest the season's crop of weed seeds, feeding usually
near woods or hedge-rows to which they go to rest and
roost. Their merry chatter is one of the season's most
cheerful notes, and in the spring we may hear their
canary-like song.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CHIPPING SPARROW<br />

<i>Spizella passerina passerina. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 45; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 31</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In summer, the chestnut cap, black bill, and whitish line over
the eye mark the 'Chippy'; but in the fall and winter the crown
is like the back, the line over the eye is brownish, and the bill
is brown; but the gray rump, shown well in flight, is a good
character the year around. L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Georgia and Mississippi to Canada; winters
from South Carolina to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., abundant T.V., Mch. 9-Nov. 11,
occasionally winters. Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 5-Nov. 7.

Apl. 5-Nov. 5. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 8-Oct. 26.</p></div>

<p>The friendly Chippy is the most familiar and domestic
of any of our native Sparrows. He makes tentative
visits to our piazzas and, cats permitting, will take up
his residence there, building a neat, hair-lined nest in the
vines or a nearby bush. Unassuming in voice as he is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
manner, his <i>Chippy-chippy-chippy</i>, many times repeated,
expresses contentment, even if it does not attain high
musical rank. Madame Chippy has fine taste in eggs,
laying, in early May, little blue gems, beautifully marked
with brown or black.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CLAY-COLORED SPARROW<br />

<i>Spizella pallida. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 48</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Clay-colored Sparrow resembles a winter Chipping
Sparrow, but is paler and has a white line over the eye and a

<p>A Chipping Sparrow of the Plains which nests on the

<div class='center'><br /><br />FIELD SPARROW<br />

<i>Spizella pusilla pusilla. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 43; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 14</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The upperparts are brighter reddish brown than in any of our

Glen Ellyn, tolerably common S.R., Mch. 27-Oct. 11. SE.
Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Dec. 28.</p></div>

<p>'Bush Sparrow,' Mr. Roosevelt always called this bird,
and the name gives a better conception of its haunts
than that of Field Sparrow, since it is found in bush-grown
fields. From a bush-top it sings its clearly whistled,
sweet, appealing song, varying the relation of notes and
trills, but never their musical quality. In a bush also
it nests, laying 3-5 white eggs, marked with reddish brown,
in May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SLATE-COLORED JUNCO<br />

<i>Junco hyemalis hyemalis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 43; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 41</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The plumage of the female is tinged with brownish, but the
prevailing tone is slate-gray, unlike that of any of our other
Sparrows. The white outer-tail feathers are conspicuously
flashed in flight. L. 6&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England and northern
New York to Canada and southward in the mountains to Pennsylvania;
winters in all the Eastern States. The Carolina Junco
(<i>J. h. carolinensis</i>), a slightly larger race without a brownish
tinge, nests in the higher parts of the Alleghanies from Maryland
to northern Georgia, descending to the adjacent lowlands in
winter.</p>

<p>Washington, abundant W.V., Sept. 26-May 12. Ossining,
common W.V., Sept. 19-May 4. Cambridge, rather common
W.V., abundant T.V., Sept. 20-Nov. 25; Mch. 20-Apl. 20.

<p>Gray skies and a snow-covered earth are the Junco
colors, and when he flashes them along the hedgerows and
wood borders we know that although it is only late
September, winter will soon be with us. From that time
until April the Junco is of our commonest birds. He
visits our food-shelf and roosts in our evergreens, becoming
almost as domestic as the Chipping Sparrow. The
Junco's call-notes are a sharp <i>tsip</i>, a contented <i>chew-chew-chew</i>,
and a sharp kissing call. Its modest, musical little
trill we shall not hear until spring. The nest is built
on the ground, and the 4-5 white, speckled, or spotted,
eggs are laid late in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BACHMAN'S SPARROW<br />

<i>Peuc&aelig;a &aelig;stivalis bachmani</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With a general resemblance to a Field Sparrow but bill black
and larger, cheeks and underparts more buffy, tail shorter, no
evident wing bars.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southeastern United States from central Georgia to
Virginia and from northwestern Florida to central Illinois;
winters from North Carolina to northern Florida.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Where 'scrub' oaks grow beneath the pines, or post,
or white oaks form open woods, there one may look for this
rather retiring, sweet-voiced Sparrow. If one can imagine
a Hermit Thrush singing the Field Sparrow's chant, he
will have some conception of the rare quality of Bachman's
Sparrow's song. The nest is built on the ground, the
white unmarked eggs being laid early in May.</p>

<p>The Pine Woods Sparrow (<i>P. &aelig;. &aelig;stivalis</i>), is a darker
race, more streaked above with black. It is resident in
Florida (except the northwestern part) and southern
Georgia where it frequents pine forests undergrown with
scrub palmetto.</p>

<p>If the so-called 'English' Sparrow is the European Sparrow,
the Song Sparrow is the American Sparrow. He is
found in every State and from the Valley of Mexico to
Alaska. He is abundant, musical, and familiar and
probably better known than any other member of his
family native to this country. His is one of the first
birds' songs to be heard in the spring, and the last in the
fall, and when in midsummer, the adults, while molting,
are silent, the rambling, formless song of the young may
be heard.</p>

<p>Usually the Song Sparrow is found near water and not
far from bushes into which he flies when alarmed. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
we hear his characteristic call-note, an impatient <i>chimp</i>,
<i>chimp</i>, unlike that of any other of our Sparrows. The
nest is built on the ground and the 4-5 bluish white
brown-marked eggs are laid late in April.</p>

<p>The Swamp Sparrow is a Sparrow of the marshes whose
<i>tweet-tweet-tweet</i> many times repeated, is associated with
the music of Marsh Wrens. It nests on the ground in
May, laying eggs not unlike those of the Song Sparrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />FOX SPARROW<br />

<i>Passerella iliaca iliaca. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 37; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 7</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large, bright, reddish brown Sparrow, which, because of its
red-brown tail, and in spite of its stout bill, is sometimes mistaken
for the Hermit Thrush. L. 7&frac12;.</p>

<p>A vigorous scratcher in the undergrowth who, using
both feet at once, kicks the leaves out behind him;
a master musician among our Sparrows whose loud,
clear, joyous notes form one of our most notable bird
songs. We hear it only for a brief time in spring and
fall as the birds pass us on their migration.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />TOWHEE<br />

<i>Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Figs. 32, 33;

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female is brown where the male is black; both are unmistakable
L. 8&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern Georgia and central Kansas;

<p><i>Chewi&#324;k, towhe&eacute;</i>, the clear, emphatic, strongly accented
call announces the presence of a bird whose colors are as
distinctive as its notes. The Towhee feeds on the ground
in and near bushy places, but when the desire to sing
comes upon him he leaves his lowly haunts and taking
a more or less exposed perch, fifteen to twenty feet from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the ground, utters his <i>sweet-bird-sin-n-n-g</i>, with an earnestness
which goes far to atone for his lack of striking musical
ability. The nest is built on the ground and the 4-5
white, finely speckled eggs are laid during the first half of
May.</p>

<p>The White-eyed Towhee (<i>P. e. alleni</i>) of Florida and
the coast region north to Charleston, South Carolina,
has the eye yellowish instead of red and the white markings
are more restricted. Its call is higher than that of the
northern bird and its song shorter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CARDINAL<br />

<i>Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Figs. 34, 35.</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male, with his conspicuous crest and bright colors, can be
confused with no other species; the female is much duller and
the crest is less prominent but still evident. L. 8&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Resident from the Gulf States to southern New York
and northern Ohio; rarely found further north.</p>

<p>Washington, common P.R.; less common than formerly.
Ossining, A.V. Cambridge, irregular but not very infrequent
at all seasons. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, rare S.R.
SE. Minn., rare.</p></div>

<p>Next to the Mockingbird's medley, the rich, mellow
whistle of the Cardinal is the most prominent bird voice
in the choir of southern songsters. Passing most of the
time in the undergrowth, where, in spite of his brilliant
colors, he readily conceals himself, he makes no
attempt, when singing, to hide his fiery plumes, but selecting
a conspicuous perch, challenges the attention of the
world.</p>

<p>The female Cardinal also sings, but her song has much
less volume than that of her mate, and is more rarely
heard. The call-note of both sexes is a minute; sharp,
<i>cheep</i>, which one would attribute to a bird half their size.
The Cardinal nests in bushes, laying 3-4 whitish eggs
speckled and spotted with brown, in April.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The Florida Cardinal (<i>C. c. floridanus</i>), a slightly smaller,
deeper colored (especially in the female) race of the preceding,
inhabits the peninsula of Florida.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUE GROSBEAK<br />

<i>Guiraca c&aelig;rulea c&aelig;rulea. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Figs. 52, 53</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Should be confused only with the Indigo Bunting, but it is
larger and the male is darker and has brown wing-bars. L. 7.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Florida to Maryland and southern Illinois;
winters in the tropics, uncommon east of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>Washington, very uncommon, S.R., May 1-Sept. 20. Cambridge,
A.V., one instance, May.</p></div>

<p>The Blue Grosbeak is an unfamiliar bird to most eastern
students. Ridgway states that its haunts resemble those
of the Field Sparrow or Indigo Bunting. Its call is a
strong, harsh <i>ptchick</i>, its song a beautiful, but rather feeble
warble. The nest is usually built in bushes and the 3-4
pale bluish white eggs are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ROSE-BREASTED GROSBEAK<br />

<i>Zamelodia ludoviciana. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 25, 26</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male needs no introduction; the streaked plumage of the
female betrays her Sparrow ancestry; the white stripe over her
eye is a conspicuous mark. Young males in the fall resemble
the female, but have a rose-tinted breast. L. 8.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from central Kansas and central New Jersey
north to Canada, and, in the mountains, south to northern
Georgia; winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common T.V., May 1-30; Aug. 29-Oct. 6.

<p>Distinguished alike by plumage and song, the Rose-breast
is one of our most notable bird citizens. His
song resembles in form that of the Robin, but has a more
lyrical, flowing, joyous quality, and, unlike the Robin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he often sings while flying. The call-note of both sexes
is a sharp <i>peek</i> which, like the Cardinal's <i>cheep</i>, seems too
small for the bird.</p>

<p>The Rose-breast lives and nests in woodland, particularly
second-growths, building a frail nest ten to twenty feet
from the ground. The 4-5 blue, brown-marked eggs are
laid the latter half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />INDIGO BUNTING<br />

<i>Passerina cyanea. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 23, 24</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male, well seen, is unmistakable. The female is very
'sparrowy' and, unless one gets a suggestion of blue in her
plumage, can best be identified by her unsparrow-like, sharp
<i>pit</i>. L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Georgia and Louisiana to Canada; winters
in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 9. Ossining, common
S.R., May 4-Oct. 17. Cambridge, common S.R., May 15-Oct. 1.

fairly common S.R., May 1-Sept. 22. SE. Minn., common S.R.
Apl. 28-Oct. 2.</p></div>

<p>"July, July, summer-summer's here; morning, noontide,
evening, list to me" the Indigo sings in rather hard
but brilliant little voice. To me the words express the
rhythm as well as the spirit of the song. We hear them
most often in bushy fields and open second-growths,
along hedge-rows or from briery clumps in which the
bird's nest may be hidden. The pale, bluish white eggs
are laid the latter half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PAINTED BUNTING<br />

<i>Passerina ciris. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Figs. 49, 50</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male is one of our most brilliantly colored birds, the female
has the color of a Vireo but the bill of a Sparrow.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southern States north to southeastern North Carolina
and southern Kansas; winters from southern Florida southward.</p></div>

<p>"Painted" Bunting he is called, but the brilliancy and
luster of his plumage were not painted by human hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
'Nonpareil' he has also been named, and, in the eastern
United States, at least, he is without equal in the brightness
of his colors. The bird's haunts are not unlike those
of the Indigo Bunting, and its song is said to resemble the
Indigo's but to be more feeble. It builds in bushes and low
trees, laying 3-4 bluish white, brown-spotted eggs in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />DICKCISSEL<br />

<i>Spiza americana. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 20</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The yellow on the breast and, in the male, black crescent will
distinguish this species from all its Sparrow kin. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Chiefly prairies of the Mississippi Valley, from Texas
and Mississippi north to Minnesota and southern Ontario; now
rare east of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>Washington, formerly "very abundant," now seen only occasionally,
May-Aug. Cambridge, casual, found nesting at
Medford, June 9. 1877, where several birds were observed; not
uncommon in 1833-34 (see Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, III, 1878,

<p>The Dickcissel is a bird of the fields who, from a weed-stalk
or fence by the wayside, sings his unmusical <i>dick-dick
cissel, cissel, cissel</i>. The nest is built on the ground
or in a bush and the 4-5 pale blue eggs are laid the latter
half of May.</p>

<h2>TANAGERS. FAMILY TANGARID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SCARLET TANAGER<br />

<i>Piranga erythromelas. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 27, 28</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The black wings and tail of the male will distinguish him from
our other two red birds&mdash;the Cardinal and Summer Tanager.
The olive-green female may be known from all our other olive-green
birds by her larger size. L. 7&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern Georgia and southern Kansas to
Canada; winters in the tropics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington, common T.V., less common S.R., Apl. 17-Oct. 15.

SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 11.</p></div>

<p>As a family Tanagers are the most strikingly colored
of American birds, but among the nearly 400 species none
appears more brilliant in life than the male Scarlet Tanager.
The leaf-colored female is as difficult to see as the
male is conspicuous. Both have the same characteristic
call&mdash;<i>chip-ch&uacute;rr, chip-ch&uacute;rr</i>. The song suggests a Robin's
but is more forced and has a hoarse undertone. They live
and nest in the woods, building on a horizontal limb
10-20 feet up. The 3-4 greenish blue, brown-marked
eggs are laid late in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SUMMER TANAGER<br />

<i>Piranga rubra rubra. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Figs. 33, 34</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The male is usually red like the Cardinal, but lacks the Cardinal's
crest; the female is more yellow than the female of the
Scarlet Tanager.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southern States; nesting north to Maryland and
Illinois; winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, uncommon S.R., Apl. 18-Sept. 19. Cambridge,
one record.</p></div>

<p>The "Summer Redbird's" <i>chicky-tucky-tuck</i>, is as clearly
pronounced and unmistakable as the Scarlet Tanager's
<i>chip-ch&uacute;rr</i>. Its song is somewhat sweeter than that of
its scarlet cousin, but bears a general resemblance to it.
Both pine and deciduous woods are inhabited by this bird.
Its nesting habits resemble those of the Scarlet Tanager.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h2>SWALLOWS. FAMILY HIRUNDINID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PURPLE MARTIN<br />

<i>Progne subis subis. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 25</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Largest of our Swallows. The female is duller above than the
male, and below is brownish gray. L. 8.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests locally from the Gulf to Canada; winters in the
tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 14. Ossining,
tolerably common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 11. Cambridge, formerly

Apl. 1-Sept. 5. Glen Ellyn, local S.R., Mch. 23-Sept. 10. SE.
Minn., common S.R., Apl. 1-Sept. 9.</p></div>

<p>Fortunate is the man whose hospitality the Martins
accept. Their cheery notes and sociability make them the
best kind of guests. The Audubon Society will send one
plans for a Martin house, and tell one where to place it.
Martins nest in May and lay white eggs.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CLIFF SWALLOW<br />

<i>Petrochelidon lunifrons lunifrons. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 55</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rusty rump is distinctive. L. 6.</p>

SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 13-Sept. 12.</p></div>

<p>Cliff Swallow it is in the West, but "Eave" Swallow
it should be in the East where the rows of flask-shaped
mud nests cluster thick beneath projecting roofs. They
prefer unpainted buildings and the modern barn rarely
knows them. The white, brown-spotted eggs are laid in
the latter half of May.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BARN SWALLOW<br />

<i>Hirundo erythrogaster. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 32</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Chestnut underparts and a forked tail are the chief characters
of this beautiful Swallow. L. 7.</p>

fairly common and increasing. Apl. 7-Sept. 1. SE. Minn.,
common S.R., Apl. 28-Aug. 31.</p></div>

<p>Barn Swallows are far more beautiful, more graceful and
more companionable than Purple Martins. But while
we are erecting special dwellings for the Martins we are
making our barns Swallow-proof. A pair of Barn Swallows
are not only cheerful neighbors but good investments.
Let us make it possible for them to enter the hay-mow.
We may even supply shelves as foundations for their
open mud nests. The white, spotted eggs are laid in the
latter half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />TREE SWALLOW<br />

<i>Iridoprocne bicolor. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 24</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Silky white below and shining bluish green above; young
birds are mouse-colored above but below are snowy white, unmarked,
as in the adult. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests chiefly from southern New England northward

<p>Washington, common T.V., Mch. 26-May 26; July 8-Oct. 14.
Ossining, common T.V., Apl. 4-May 26; Aug. 4-Oct. 16. Cambridge,

<p>We see comparatively few Tree Swallows during the
spring, but from July to October, as they journey slowly
southward, they are the most abundant members of their
family. In countless thousands long ropes of Swallows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
crowd the wayside wires from pole to pole. At night,
with others of their tribe, they roost in the marshes.</p>

<p>Tree Swallows they are called because they nest in
hollow trees and, like some other hole-nesting birds, they
may be induced to occupy nesting-boxes, making a
welcome addition to our list of bird tenants. The 4-7
white eggs are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BANK SWALLOW<br />

<i>Riparia riparia. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>. Fig. 54</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Note the small size, dull plumage, and breast-band. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> A native of the Old World as well as of the New.
In North America nesting from Louisiana and Virginia nearly

<p>The Bank Swallow is a bird of the air who tunnels the
earth for a nesting-place. Where river or road has left a
bank, its face may be dotted with the entrances to the
Bank Swallow's dwellings. At the end of two or three
feet the nest of grass and feathers is placed, fit receptacle
for the pearl-white eggs, which are usually laid the latter
half of May.</p>

<p>During the migrations the Bank Swallow travels with
other members of its family, sharing their roost in the
marshes by night and their wayside perch by day.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW<br />

<i>Stelgidopteryx serripennis. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 56</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With the general appearance of the Bank Swallow, but slightly

<p>Least common of our Swallows. It nests in small colonies
of about half a dozen pairs, sometimes in holes, at others
under bridges, crevices in cliffs and similar situations.
In the fall, it flocks with other species of its family. Its
4-8 white eggs are laid the latter half of May.</p>

<h2>WAXWINGS. FAMILY BOMBYCILLID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BOHEMIAN WAXWING<br />

<i>Bombycilla garrula</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Similar to the Cedar Waxwing, but larger, the primary coverts
and secondaries tipped with white, the primaries tipped with
white or yellow, the under tail-coverts chestnut. L. 8.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Western Canada; in winter east to Minnesota and
rarely as far as Connecticut.</p>

<p>Glen Ellyn, one record, Jan. 22, 1908. SE. Minn., irregular
W.V., until Apl. 1.</p></div>

<p>There are comparatively few authentic records of this
beautiful bird east of the Alleghanies. Enthusiastic
bird-students are, I fear, apt to give Waxwings, seen in
winter, the benefit of the doubt and call them 'Bohemians.'
Look especially for the white marks on the Bohemian's
wings. Its large size might not be apparent unless the two
species were seen together.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CEDAR WAXWING<br />

<i>Bombycilla cedrorum. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 40; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 54</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Crest usually conspicuous; tail tipped with yellow; a black
'bridle.'</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from North Carolina and Kansas to Canada;
winters irregularly throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Washington, very common P.R., less so in winter. Ossining,
common P.R. Cambridge, not common P.R., common S.R.,
abundant T.V. in spring, Feb. 1-Apl. 25. N. Ohio, irregularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
common in summer. Glen Ellyn. S.R., Jan. 21-Sept. 24;
occasional W.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Feb. 25-Sept. 28.</p></div>

<p>A Waxwing's crest is as expressive as a horse's ears.
One moment it points skyward the next it flattens and disappears.
They are as sociable as "Love Birds," traveling
in small flocks which, like one bird, dive into a tree and
perch so close together that often several will be almost
touching, and with common accord they take wing. They
feed mainly on small fruit both wild and cultivated but are
also expert flycatchers. They nest in June, usually in
shade or fruit trees, building a well-made nest for the
beautiful, clay-colored, black-spotted eggs.</p>

<p>A grim, gray bird that comes out of the far North in the
fall. His mission is death to birds and mice and he makes
no attempt to disguise it but boldly advertises his presence
by perching where he may be seen as well as see. Mice he
can plunge on, but Sparrows, Siskins or Redpolls he may
have to pursue on the wing, following every twist and turn
until he reaches striking distance. Slowly he bears his
victim, in his feet, to some tree there to hang it on thorn
or in crotch from which it may be devoured at leisure.
An executioner by birth, the Shrike or "Butcher Bird"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
evidently pursues his calling with no regrets and when
spring time approaches adds his voice to the chorus of bird
song.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE<br />

<i>Lanius ludovicianus ludovicianus. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 55</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A gray bird with black wings and tail marked with white which
shows in flight; smaller than the Northern Shrike with a black
forehead and unmarked breast. L. 9.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Florida north to North Carolina, west to Louisiana.</p></div>

<p>The Loggerhead has the general habits of his larger
northern cousin the "Butcher-bird," but he feeds, as a rule,
on smaller game. Grasshoppers and lizards form the
larger part of his fare and the barbed wire fences not
infrequently are his shambles. A flight is ended by an
upward swing to the chosen perch which may be a tree-top,
a telegraph wire, or lightning-rod tip. From such
a lookout he keeps a sharp watch for his prey, which he
detects at surprisingly long distances; meanwhile uttering
the gurgles, squeaks and pipes which constitute his
song. The nest is built in hedges or low trees in early
March. The 3-5 eggs are dull white thickly marked with
brown and lavender.</p>

<p>The Migrant Shrike (<i>Lanius ludovicianus migrans</i>) is
a northern race of the Loggerhead from which it differs
only in being somewhat paler above and grayer below.
It is a Summer Resident from Kansas and western North
Carolina to Minnesota and Maine and winters from the
Middle States southward.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it may be said that any Shrike found
north of Maryland in the winter is a Northern Shrike;
that any Shrike found north of Virginia in the summer is
a Migrant Shrike, and that any Shrike found south of
that state in the summer is a Loggerhead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h2>VIREOS. FAMILY VIREONID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK-WHISKERED VIREO<br />

<i>Vireosylva calidris barbatula</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Resembles the Red-eyed Vireo but has a dusky streak on each
side of the throat.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Cuba and Bahamas, north in spring to southern
Florida.</p></div>

<p>This is a tropical species which reaches southern Florida
early in May and returns to its winter home after nesting.
In general habits and notes it resembles the Red-eye.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-EYED VIREO<br />

<i>Vireosylva olivasceus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 66</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An olive-green bird, silky white below, a white line, bordered
by black over the red eye, a grayish cap and no white band
on the wings. L. 6&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from the Gulf to Canada; winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, very common S.R., Apl. 21-Oct. 17. Ossining,
common S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 19. Cambridge, abundant S.R.,

Glen Ellyn, common S.R., May 5-Oct. 5. SE. Minn., common
S.R., May 5-Sept. 15.</p></div>

<p>A tireless soliloquist, the Red-eyed Vireo repeats from
our shade and fruit trees in endless succession the broken
phrases of his monotonous, rambling recitation. He sings
all day and he sings throughout the summer, pausing only
to sleep or to swallow the caterpillar he hunts while
singing. Patient, persistent mediocrity is expressed by
the Red-eye's song, and only his nasal, petulant call-note,
<i>whang</i>, suggests that he is not altogether satisfied with life
as he finds it.</p>

<p>The nest, like that of our other Vireos, is a deep cup
hung from between a crotch from 5 to about 40 feet above
the ground. The 3-4 eggs, which are laid in late May, are
white spotted with reddish brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WARBLING VIREO<br />

<i>Vireosylva gilva gilva. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 29</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smaller than the Red-eye, without black and white lines over
the brown eye, the underparts faintly tinged with yellowish.
L. 5&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Louisiana and North Carolina to Canada;
winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 21-Sept. 12. Ossining,
tolerably common S.R., May 3-Sept. 18. Cambridge, locally

17-Oct. 10. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 1-Sept. 15.
SE. Minn., common S.R., May 3-Sept. 15.</p></div>

<p>While the Red-eye's song lasts the greater part of the
day, the Warbling Vireo's continues for only about four
seconds, then, after an interval, it is repeated. It is an
unbroken strain running up and down the middle of the
scale and has it in a reminder of the Purple Finch's lay.
This species is less generally distributed than the Red-eye.
It may be common in one locality and absent from
another. Its nesting habits and eggs are much like those
of the Red-eye, but the male has the singular custom of
singing while it sits upon the nest.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PHILADELPHIA VIREO<br />

<i>Vireosylva philadelphicus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 30</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A small, olive-green Vireo, with pale yellow underparts and a

<p>Rarest of our Vireos; but few students know it as a
migrant and fewer still as a nesting bird. Its song and
nesting habits resemble those of the Red-eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-THROATED VIREO<br />

<i>Lanivireo flavifrons. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 69</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Breast bright yellow; a yellow ring around the eye, two white
wing-bands, bill rather stout. L. 6.</p>

25. Glen Ellyn, not common S.R., May 2-Sept. 26. SE
Minn., common S.R., Apl. 27-Sept. 15.</p></div>

<p>A less common bird than the Red-eye, but like it generally
distributed through woodland, garden and orchard.
It's song resembles the Red-eye's in form but is richer
in tone, more deliberately uttered, and not continuous.
"See me&mdash;I'm here&mdash;where are you?" he seems to say,
and after a pause repeats the query.</p>

<p>The nest has the deep cup-shape of our other Vireo's
but is externally covered with lichens. The eggs, laid the
latter part of May, are white with a few specks of black
or brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUE-HEADED VIREO<br />

<i>Lanivireo solitarius solitarius. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 68</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Eye-ring and lores white, head grayish blue, underparts white,
the sides yellowish; two wing-bars. L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from the mountains of northern New Jersey

<p>We know this Vireo chiefly as a migrant, one of the
earliest of the group of small arboreal wood-haunting
birds (Vireos and Warblers) to reach us in the spring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Its song, as well as its movements, are deliberate. Vireo-like
it peers beneath the leaves or inspects the blossoms,
removing a caterpillar here or an insect's egg there, the
while singing leisurely a rich-toned rendering of the Red-eye's
theme.</p>

<p>It nests late in May, hanging its cup-shaped basket to a
crotch usually five to ten feet above the ground. The
eggs are white with a few black or brown spots.</p>

<p>The Mountain Solitary Vireo (<i>L. s. alticola</i>) has a slightly
larger bill and bluer back. It nests in the mountains from
Maryland to Georgia and winters southward to Florida.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-EYED VIREO<br />

<i>Vireo griseus griseus. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 67</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>White or yellowish white eyes; whitish underparts, washed
with yellow on the sides. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Florida and Texas to Wisconsin and Massachusetts;
winters from South Carolina to the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., Apl. 18-Oct. 19. Ossining, common
S.R., Apl. 29-Oct. 3. Cambridge, rare S.R., May 8-Sept.
20; formerly common. Glen Ellyn, rare, spring only,
May 24-June 5.</p></div>

<p>An inhabitant of bushy undergrowths whose snappy
calls possess almost the character of human speech, so
clearly and emphatically are the syllables enunciated.
One's presence seems to excite both his curiosity and his
disapproval, for he looks one over from this side and that
all the while giving expression to remarks which sound
far from complimentary. The nest is hung from a
crotch, rarely more than 6 feet from the ground. The
eggs laid in April, in the South, in May in the North, are
white with a few blackish spots.</p>

<p>The Key West Vireo (<i>V. g. maynardi</i>) has a longer bill
and is somewhat paler below than the White-eye. It is
resident in southern Florida and the Keys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BELL'S VIREO<br />

<i>Vireo belli belli. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 65</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smallest of our Vireos; crown ashy, lores and eye-ring whitish.
L. 4&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Mississippi Valley; nests from Texas to northwestern
Indiana and South Dakota; winters in the tropics.</p></div>

<p>Resembles the White-eye in habits, notes, and choice of
haunts, but, according to Goss, its notes are not so harsh
and emphatic.</p>

<h2>WOOD WARBLERS. FAMILY MNIOTILTID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK AND WHITE WARBLER<br />

<i>Mniotilta varia. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 57</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female is less conspicuously striped than the male, but
both are quite unlike any of our other birds. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Georgia and Louisiana to Canada; winters

<p>This species and the three Nuthatches are our only
birds that creep down as well as up; but the Nuthatches
wear no body stripes and are otherwise too unlike the
Creeper to be confused with him. The Downy Woodpecker
'hitches' himself upward advancing by jerks;
the Brown Creeper, true to its name, <i>creeps</i>. The nest
is built on the ground and the white, brown-marked eggs
are laid in April in the South, in May in the North.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />PROTHONOTARY WARBLER<br />

<i>Protonotaria citrea. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 29</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female is duller than the male, but is too like him to be
mistaken for the mate of any other Warbler, while he is in a class
by himself. L. 5&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Florida to Delaware and southeastern
Minnesota; winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, of irregular occurrence in May. N. Ohio, one
record, May 9. Glen Ellyn, rare, spring only, May 13-15. SE.
Minn., common S.R., of Mississippi bottoms, May 7-Aug. 16.</p></div>

<p>No description or illustration prepares one for the gleaming
beauty of the Golden Swamp Warbler. Cypress
swamps or willow-bordered sloughs, where it may nest
in the opening in old stubs, are its chosen haunts, and in
such places it is sometimes found in numbers. The
white eggs, thickly marked with brown, are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SWAINSON'S WARBLER<br />

<i>Helinaia swainsoni. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 28</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No wing-bars, plain brown above, white below. L. 5.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> In summer from Florida and Louisiana north to
southern Illinois and southeastern Virginia; winters in the
tropics.</p></div>

<p>Comparatively few bird students have seen this retiring
Warbler in its haunts. "Water, tangled thickets, patches
of cane, and a rank growth of semi-aquatic plants,"
Brewster states, seem indispensable to its existence. Its
song in general effect, the same writer says, recalls that of
the Northern Water-Thrush. The nest is built in bushes,
canes, etc., and the white eggs are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WORM-EATING WARBLER<br />

<i>Helmitheros vermivorus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 31</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Head striped with black and buff; body unstreaked, no wing-bars.

<p>Washington, quite common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 15. Ossining,
common S.R., May 7-Aug. 23. Cambridge, A.V., one instance,
Sept.</p></div>

<p>Comparatively few bird students can claim close acquaintance
with this slow-moving, dull-colored bird who
lives on or near the ground, usually in dry woodlands. Its
song, resembling that of the Chipping Sparrow, will attract
only an attentive ear, while its local distribution further prevents
it from being more commonly known. It nests on
the ground, the white, brown-marked eggs being laid in
May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BACHMAN'S WARBLER<br />

<i>Vermivora bachmani. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Figs. 20, 21</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All but the central pair of feathers with white spots near the

decurved. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> In summer known from Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri; in winter
recorded only from Cuba.</p></div>

<p>When migrating, this little-known species associates with
other bird travelers and may be found high or low. When
nesting, it frequents swampy woods and, although it
usually sings from the tree-tops, it builds in bushes within
a few feet of the ground, laying 3-4 white eggs in the latter
half of April or in May. Its song has been compared to
that of both the Parula Warbler and the Chipping Sparrow.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUE-WINGED WARBLER<br />

<i>Vermivora pinus. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 35</i></div>

<p>In second growths, among birches, and at the border
of the woods one may hear the wheezy, lazy, <i>swee-chee</i>
of the Blue-wing. I make it a rule to see the singer
always with the hope that he may prove to be the rare
Brewster's Warbler, which usually sings like the Blue-wing,
but in color is nearer the Golden-wing, being, in
fact, like the Golden-wing but with the underparts and
cheeks white unmarked with black. It appears to be a
hybrid between the Blue-wing and Golden-wing. (Case
7, Fig. 38.)</p>

<p>A much rarer supposed hybrid between these two
Warblers is known as Lawrence's Warbler. It is yellow
below, like the Blue-wing, but has the black throat and
cheeks of the Golden-wing. Some individuals sing like
the Blue-wing, others like the Golden-wing, and this is
true also of Brewster's Warbler. (<a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Fig. 37.)</p>

<p>The Blue-wing nests on the ground, laying 4-5 white
delicately speckled eggs the latter part of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GOLDEN-WINGED WARBLER<br />

<i>Vermivora chrysoptera. <a href="#Case_7">Case 7</a>, Figs. 34, 36</i></div>

<p>The Golden-wing's <i>zee-zee-zee-zee</i> resembles the Blue-wing's
song in tone but the syllables are all on one note.
When nesting, the Golden-wing prefers second growths,
and birches, but when migrating it may be found in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
woods with others of its family. The nest is made on the
ground, and the eggs, which resemble those of the Blue-wing,
but are more heavily marked, are laid in May or
early June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />NASHVILLE WARBLER<br />

<p>Thayer in "Warblers of North America" says that the
Nashville is one of the most agile and restless of the
gleaning Warblers. It prefers birches, but is found
in rather open growths of other trees. Its commoner
song consists of a string of six or eight or more lively rapid
notes, running into a rolling twitter. It has also a flight-song.</p>

<p>The nest is placed on the ground; the eggs, which are
laid in May or early June, are white, spotted with reddish
brown.</p>

<p>The Orange-crown is a rare fall migrant in the North
Atlantic States, but common in Florida and southern
Georgia in the winter. It frequents the upper branches
of trees though, as with most members of its genus, it nests
on the ground. Its call-note is a sharp, characteristic
<i>chip;</i> its song is said to resemble that of the Chipping
Sparrow.</p>

<p>A common migrant, traveling with other Wood Warblers,
but in summer usually restricted to swampy localities
where usnea moss flourishes. Of, or rather <i>in</i> this, it
makes its nest, laying 4-5 white, brown-marked eggs
the latter half of May. To describe its song as several
wheezy notes running into a little trill, conveys no idea of
pleasing character. It is easily recognized and, in time,
acquires associations with what, to bird-lovers, is the
most delightful season of the year.</p>

<p>The Southern Parula Warbler (<i>C. a. americana</i>) is a
slightly smaller race with less black about the lores and
on the breast in the male. It summers in the Southeastern
States north to Virginia, and winters in the

but it nests in the hanging, gray tillandsia or Spanish
'moss' instead of in usnea.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CAPE MAY WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica tigrina. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 65, 66</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Male with chestnut cheek-patches and a white patch on the

<p>This beautiful Warbler was formerly considered one of
our rarer migrants, but of recent years it appears to be
increasing in numbers. On its nesting ground the bird
is said to frequent the upper branches of tall evergreens
(though one of the few nests which has been found was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
within three feet of the ground), but when migrating it
may be found in the trees of lawns, orchards, and woodland
and I have seen it among poke-berries. The Cape
May's song is a thin squeak which is compared to the
songs of the Black and White and also Blackpoll Warblers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica &aelig;stiva &aelig;stiva. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 40, 41</i></div>

<p>Show me willows over water and any day in May or
June I'll show you a Yellow Warbler. Shade and fruit
trees also attract him and he may build his cotton-padded
nest in their branches or in the shrubbery below. The
song is a simple <i>we-chee, chee, chee, chee, cher-wee</i>, resembling
that of the Chestnut-side, but has its own distinctive
tone which permits of ready identification, once it has been
learned. The bluish white eggs, thickly marked with
shades of brown, are laid the latter half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER<br />

<p>A true Wood Warbler, traveling through the trees with
the scattered bands of other members of his family as he
journeys to and from his summer home. This, in the
northern part of his nesting range, is in coniferous forests,
in the southern part, deciduous forests. In both, however,
the birds require heavy undergrowth in which their
bark-covered nest is built within a foot or two of the
ground. The grayish white, brown-marked eggs are laid
in late May or early June. Miss Paddock in "Warblers
of North America" describes the Black-throated Blue's
song as "an insect-like buzzing note repeated three or
four times with a rising inflection."</p>

<p>Cairn's Warbler (<i>D. c. cairnsi</i>) is a nearly related race
having, in the male, black centers to the feathers of the
back. It nests in the upper parts of the Alleghanies, from
Maryland to Georgia, and winters in the West Indies.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MYRTLE WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica coronata. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 27</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The yellow rump is always evident, but in fall and winter

<p>A hardy Warbler which, like the Tree Swallow, can
substitute bayberries for insects. When the former are
available some individuals remain in the North, enduring
our winters without apparent discomfort. Its call-note,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<i>tchep</i>, is as distinctive as its markings, and this fact connected
with its general distribution and abundance,
makes it one of the best known members of this little-known
family.</p>

<p>Thayer in "Warblers of North America" describes its
common song as "a loud silvery 'sleigh-bell' trill, a vivid,
sprightly utterance."</p>

<p>It nests in coniferous forests, building from four to
twenty feet from the ground and laying 3-5 white eggs
marked with shades of brown, in late May or early June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MAGNOLIA WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica magnolia. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 42</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female is duller than the male, but both have the crown
gray, a white stripe behind the eye, a yellow rump and the white
tail-patches near the middle of the tail, making the tail, when
seen from below, appear white, broadly banded with black.

<p>A common migrant distinguished by the beauty of his
costume even in this family of gayly clad birds. When
traveling, the Magnolia may be found in woods and
woody growth of varied character, but when nesting, it
shows a fondness for spruce forests, building in small
spruces usually within six feet of the ground.</p>

<p>The Magnolia's song resembles the Yellow Warbler's
in tone. Thayer in "Warblers of North America"
describes it as "peculiar and easily remembered; <i>weeto:
weeto-weee&eacute;te-eet</i>, or <i>witchi, witchi, witchi tit</i>, the first four
notes deliberate and even and comparatively low in tone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the last three hurried and higher pitched, with decided
emphasis on the antepenult <i>weet</i> or <i>witch</i>."</p>

<p>The eggs, laid in the first half of June, are white marked
with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CERULEAN WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica rara. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 46, 47</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adult male will be recognized at sight, but the female and
young must be looked at sharply. The whitish or yellowish line
over the eye, in connection with the white wing-bars make a fair
field-mark. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p>A tree-top Warbler of deciduous forests, nesting from
25 to 60 feet above the ground. Its song bears a marked
resemblance to that of the Parula and its call-note is said
to be like the <i>tchep</i> of the Myrtle Warbler. The white
eggs, heavily blotched with brown, are laid in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica pensylvanica. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 43, 44</i></div>

<p>Scrubby second growths undergrown with bushes, roadside
borders of trees and bushes, and the brushy margins
of woods are all resorts of the Chestnut-side. Here
he attracts our attention by his rather loud, frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
uttered song, which strongly suggests that of the Yellow
Warbler. The nest is built within a few feet of the
ground and the white, brown-marked eggs are laid the
latter part of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BAY-BREASTED WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica castanea. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 69, 70</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The adult male is unmistakable; the female has chestnut on

<p>The Bay-breast is one of the rarer members of its family.
Most of us know it only as a migrant passing northward
in May and southward in September, when it may be
found in woodlands associated with other migrating
Warblers. Its song resembles that of the Black and White
Warbler. Mrs. Farwell describes it as "a poor, weak,
monotonous saw-filing note." The nest has been found
in hemlocks 15-20 feet from the ground. The white
eggs, finely marked with shades of brown, are laid in
June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK-POLL WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica striata. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 71, 72</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the spring, a black cap, white cheeks and a gray, black
streaked back distinguish the male; a gray, black-streaked back,
the female. In the fall, young and old are olive-green, streaked
with black above; yellowish white below, and thus closely resembles
the young Bay-breast. L. 5&frac12;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the end of the May Warbler 'waves' the Blackpolls
come in force. They are excessively fat and, perhaps
for this reason, move rather slowly for a Warbler. They
are Wood Warblers, but at this season may overflow into
the trees of our lawns and orchards. Mrs. Farwell
describes the Blackpoll's song as "a succession of hesitating,
staccato, unmusical notes varying greatly in volume.
The notes separated, not combined in twos, as in
the Black and White Warbler's song." When nesting
this Warbler frequents stunted spruce forests, placing
its nest in these trees a few feet above the ground, and
laying 4-5 white, brown-marked eggs the latter part of
June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica fusca. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 67, 68</i></div>

<p>The remoteness of their homes prevents us from making
the acquaintance of the brilliantly plumaged birds of the
tropics, but among them all we will find none more
beautiful than this flame-breasted Warbler, which each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
spring comes from his tropical winter home almost to our
doors. In the summer he seeks the seclusion of coniferous
forests and the higher branches of spruce or hemlock.
There his nest is made sometimes 80 or more feet above
the ground, and in late May or early June the white eggs,
spotted, speckled and blotched with brown, are laid. The
Blackburnian's song is described by Miss Paddock in
"Warblers of North America" as "very shrill and fine,
growing even more shrill and wiry as it rises toward
the end."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-THROATED WARBLER<br />

<i>Dendroica dominica dominica. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 18</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A gray Warbler with a yellow throat. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

Apl. 19-Sept. 4.</p></div>

<p>The loud, ringing <i>ching-ching-ching, chicker, cherwee</i> of
the Yellow-throated Warbler is one of the characteristic
bird songs of spring in southern woods. The bird usually
sings from the upper branches of tall trees, often cypresses,
in Florida, but further north, from pines, where he can
be far more easily heard than seen. The nest is placed
30-40 feet from the ground and the white eggs, thickly
marked with shades of brown, are laid in April.</p>

<p>The Sycamore Warbler (<i>D. d. albilora, <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 19</i>)
is a nearly related race of the Yellow-throat which inhabits
the Mississippi Valley nesting as far north as southern
Michigan and wintering in the tropics. It differs from the
Atlantic coast form in having a smaller bill and no yellow
in front of the eye. As its name implies, it favors sycamore
trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The quiet little <i>zee-zee, zee-ee-zee</i> of the Black-throated
Green announces the arrival of the vanguard of true
Wood Warblers, which for the succeeding two weeks will
pass in countless numbers through our woodlands, still
almost leafless. At this time we may find him wherever
trees grow, but his real summer home is coniferous forests,
especially of hemlocks, in which he often builds his nests
15-20 feet above the ground. The eggs, laid in late
May or early June, are white spotted and speckled with
brown.</p>

<p>A southern form of this Warbler (<i>D. v. waynei</i>) has been
described from the vicinity of Charleston, S.C.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />KIRTLAND'S WARBLER<br />

<p>Kirtland's Warbler has one of the smallest nesting areas
of any North American bird and consequently is one of
our rarest species. In the summer it lives among
the jack-pines of north central Michigan, nesting on the
ground beneath them. When migrating, it may be found
usually near the ground, where it may be identified
by its habit of tail-wagging. Its song is described
by Wood in "Warblers of North America" as belonging
to the whistling type with the clear, ringing quality of the
Oriole's. The 3-5 eggs, laid early in June, are white
speckled with brown in a wreath at the larger end.</p>

<p>Pine Warblers seem almost as much a part of pine
woods as the trees themselves. They feed on the ground
below the pines, they glean from the bark of the trunk,
or from the clusters of 'needles' on the topmost boughs,
the very peace of the pines is expressed in their calm,
even, musical trill; and where there are no pines there
are no Pine Warblers. During the migration, it is true,
they may be found elsewhere, but at that season they are
travelers, and travelers cannot always be responsible for
their surroundings. Their nest, of course, is always built
in pines, usually from 30-50 feet above the ground. The
eggs laid in March in the South, and early June in the
North, are white wreathed with brown at the larger end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A tail-wagging Warbler that frequents bushy places,
weedy fields and open pine woods and gardens, living near
the ground where it may be easily seen. Its call-note,
<i>chip</i>, is distinctive and one learns in time to recognize
it. Its song is a trill, clear and sweet, but by no means
loud.</p>

<p>The Palm Warbler (<i>D. p. palmarum</i>) is the Mississippi
Valley form of the Atlantic coast race, from which it
differs in having the line over the eye white instead of yellow;
the yellow of the underparts paler and confined to
the throat and breast. It is not infrequent during the fall
migration in the North Atlantic States and, in Florida, is
far more common than the Yellow Palm.</p>

are the haunts of the miscalled Prairie Warbler. Common
and generally distributed in the South, it is local in the
North and not always found in districts which seem to
supply all its wants. Its song is composed of six or seven
minute <i>zees</i>, the next to the last one usually the highest.
The nest is generally built within 4 feet of the ground, the

<p>The Oven-bird, and its near relatives the Water-Thrushes,
bear so little resemblance in color and habits
to the true Wood Warblers, that one might well think
they were members of another family. Their plumage
lacks the bright colors, white wing-bars and tail-patches
possessed by most Warblers, and, instead of hopping and
flitting from twig to twig, they spend their time chiefly
<i>walking</i> on the ground, where they find their food.</p>

<p>It is not so much its abundance as its song which makes
the Oven-bird well known. Years ago Mr. Burroughs
wrote it, <i>teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher</i>, and no
one has improved on this description. The Oven-bird<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
also sings an ecstatic warbling on the wing; a thrilling
performance. The nest is built on the ground and, like
a Dutch oven, is roofed over with the entrance at one
side. The eggs, laid in May, are white, marked chiefly
at the larger end with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />NORTHERN WATER-THRUSH<br />

<p>The two Water-Thrushes and the Oven-bird are <i>walking</i>
Warblers, and the Water-Thrushes, furthermore, are
<i>teeterers</i>, nervously tipping tail and body with apparently
exhaustless energy. When migrating, the Northern
Water-Thrush often seeks refuge beneath the shrubbery
of our lawns, but when nesting it frequents the borders
of streams in deep woods, building its home on the ground
or in the roots of an upturned tree. Its call-note is a sharp
<i>chink;</i> its song a hurried rush of loud musical notes, closing
abruptly. The 4-5 eggs, laid in the latter half of
May or early June, are white with numerous brown
markings chiefly about the larger end.</p>

<p>Grinnell's Water-Thrush (<i>S. n. notabilis</i>), a slightly
larger and darker form, nests in the Northwest and is
casually found as a migrant on the Atlantic coast.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LOUISIANA WATER-THRUSH<br />

<i>Seiurus motacilla. <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 5</i></div>

<p>A shy spirit of woodland brooks, the Louisiana Water-Thrush
resembles the Northern Water-Thrush in habits
but is more difficult to see; its call-note is louder, its song,
wilder, more ringing. Like the Oven-bird it also has a
flight, or 'ecstasy'-song. It nests in a bank or among
the roots of a fallen tree, laying 4-6 eggs, white with
numerous brown markings, in late April or early May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />KENTUCKY WARBLER<br />

<i>Oporornis formosus. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 52</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A yellow line from the bill around the eye; crown blackish;

<p>Wet woodland with luxuriant undergrowth of bushes,
ferns and skunk cabbage are the favorite haunts of this
sweet-voiced Warbler, and its nest is usually built among
vegetation of this character. Its freely uttered song is a
loud, clear two-syllabled whistle, in tone like the voice of
the Carolina Wren or Cardinal. Its 4-5 eggs, laid in late
May or early June, are white, speckled chiefly about the
larger end with shades of brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CONNECTICUT WARBLER<br />

<i>Oporornis agilis. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 77, 78</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A complete white eye-ring; male without black on the gray

<p>In the Atlantic Coast States this Warbler is found only
as a fall migrant, at times in considerable numbers. It
lives on the ground in or at the border of woods usually
where there is dense undergrowth, and would easily escape
observation were it not for its sharp call-note, <i>peek</i>,
by which it may be identified. Its song, heard only on
its migrations up the Mississippi Valley and on its nesting
ground, has been described as resembling that of both the
Oven-bird and Maryland Yellow-throat. The only nest
recorded was found by Ernest Seton near Carberry,
Manitoba, June 21, 1883. It was on the ground and
contained 4 eggs, white with a few spots about the larger
end.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MOURNING WARBLER<br />

<p>The Mourning Warbler is one of the rarer Warblers
which, by good fortune, we may occasionally see toward
the end of the spring migration. It is usually found in
the lower growth, being a brush and tangle haunter of
woods and clearings. Its song, which is described as
clear and ringing, is uttered frequently, often from a dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
limb. The nest is built in briars or bushes within a foot
or two of the ground. The eggs, laid in the first half
of June, are white with a few brownish spots at the larger
end.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT<br />

<i>Geothlypis trichas trichas. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 50, 51</i></div>

<p>A fidgety, inquisitive inhabitant of bushy undergrowth
along roadsides and wood borders, whose impatient off-repeated
call-note, <i>chack, chack</i>, and energetic song of
<i>wichity, wichity, wichity</i>, soon become familiar to the
bird-student. It nests on or near the ground and the
white, lightly spotted eggs are laid in the latter half
of May.</p>

<p>The Florida Yellow-throat (<i>G. t. ignota</i>), a more deeply
colored race, is found from North Carolina to southern
Florida. In the last-named State it usually inhabits
scrub palmetto growths.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT<br />

<i>Icteria virens virens. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 49</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large bird, superficially, quite unlike the true Warblers but
nevertheless agreeing with them in essential structure. L. 7&frac12;.</p>

15. Glen Ellyn, local, not common. May 10-Aug. 16.
SE. Minn., rare S.R. (?).</p></div>

<p>If the Chat lived in England what a wealth of lore,
legend, and literature would owe its origin to his strange
ways and stranger notes! Here he is known to few but the
initiated, who find an endless interest in his odd song-medley
and peculiar antics. Go yourself to the brush-grown,
thickety wood borders and clearings he loves and
let him be his own interpreter. You may even find his
nest low down in some crotch with its white, evenly
speckled eggs, and hear his angry <i>ch&#365;t</i> as he resents your
presence.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />HOODED WARBLER<br />

<i>Wilsonia citrina. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 54, 55</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The yellow face and black 'hood' distinguishes the male, but
both sexes may be known by the large amount of white in the

<p>Color, song, habit and temperament combine to make
the Hooded Warbler one of the most attractive members of
its family. As one sees it flitting from bush to bush in
woodland undergrowth, displaying its white outer tail-feathers
as it flies, pausing now and again to utter its
simple, sweet whistled song, one is impressed not only
by its beauty but by its gentleness. It nests in a bush
within a foot or two of the ground, laying 3-5 white eggs,
wreathed with shades of brown spots, early in May, in
the South, in June, in the North.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WILSON'S WARBLER<br />

<i>Wilsonia pusilla pusilla. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 73, 74</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female usually lacks the black cap, when she resembles the

<p>Wilson's Warbler, a flycatching Warbler of the lower
growth, favors bushes near water, but is also found in
dryer places. Thayer in "Warblers of North America"
says that its "song has much of the ringing clarity of the
Canada's and Hooded's songs." It nests on the ground,
laying 4 eggs, usually with a wreath of spots at the larger
end, early in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CANADIAN WARBLER<br />

<i>Wilsonia canadensis. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 53</i></div>

<p>The Canadian Warbler haunts the lower growth of
deciduous forests. It is "a sprightly, wide-awake,
fly-snapping Warbler, vivid in movement and in song"
(Thayer). "The song is liquid, uncertain, varied, bright
and sweet" (Farwell). It nests on the ground early in
June, laying 4-5 eggs much like those of Wilson's Warbler.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />REDSTART<br />

<i>Setophaga ruticilla. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Figs. 57, 58</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The female is yellow where the male is flame-color; young
males resemble the female, but usually have more or less black

<p>His bright colors, graceful, aerial pirouetting, abundance,
and frequently uttered song make the Redstart the most
conspicuous as well as one of the most attractive of our
woodland Warblers. So exquisite a creature should be as
widely known as are violets or daisies. The Redstart
builds its well-made nest in a crotch, usually about fifteen
feet above the ground. The 4-5 grayish white eggs,
spotted and blotched chiefly at the larger end, are laid in
mid-May.</p>

<h2>WAGTAILS AND PIPITS. FAMILY MOTACILLID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />AMERICAN PIPIT<br />

<i>Anthus rubescens. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 62; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 17</i></div>

not common T.V., Apl. 15-; Sept. 30-Oct. 18. SE. Minn.,
common T.V., May 4-; Oct.</p></div>

<p>At first glance a Pipit might be mistaken for a Sparrow&mdash;let
us say, a Vesper Sparrow; but note that it walks, instead
of hops, that it constantly wags or 'tips' its tail,
that it has a slender, not stout bill. Meadows, pastures,
plowed fields, golf-courses, are frequented by Pipits,
usually in flocks of a dozen or more. When flushed, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a faint <i>dee-dee</i>, they bound lightly into the air but usually
soon return to earth.</p>

<p>Sprague's Pipit (<i>Anthus spraguei</i>), a slightly smaller
species, nests in Montana, Dakota, and northward, and
is sometimes found in small numbers on the coast of South
Carolina and Georgia in winter.</p>

to Massachusetts; winters from Maryland southward.</p>

<p>Washington, uncommon P.R., less numerous in winter. Cambridge,
rare S.R., Mch. to Nov.</p></div>

<p>No southern garden is complete without a Mockingbird
to guard its treasures with his harsh alarm-note and
extol its beauties in his brilliant, varied song. He is to
the South what the Robin is to the North&mdash;and more, for
he is present throughout the year while the Robin is with
us only during the nesting season.</p>

<p>The Mocker builds in bushes, orange-trees or other
dense vegetation, from late March, in southern Florida,
to early May in Virginia. The 4-6 eggs are blue heavily
marked with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CATBIRD<br />

<p>If the Catbird's name were based on his song instead of
on his call-note, he might have won the popularity he
deserves, but which seems forever denied him. Taking
kindly to civilization he makes his home near ours, asking
only the shelter of our shrubbery and a share of our small
fruits in return for three months of music such as but
few birds can produce.</p>

<p>The Catbird nests in bushes and thickets laying 3-5
greenish blue eggs in May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BROWN THRASHER<br />

<p>In the wealth of new experiences and awakened associations
which crowd the bird-lover's days in April and May,
none stands out more clearly in my memory than the first
Thrasher's song.</p>

<p>The rich, distinctly enunciated notes ring loud and clear
above all other songs as the bird from some tree-top gives
his musical message to the world. The performance
concluded he returns to the undergrowth whence one may
hear his explosive, whistled <i>whe&egrave;u</i> or sharp kissing note.
The nest is built in bushy growths or on the ground in
May. The 3-6 eggs are grayish white finely speckled
with reddish brown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

Ohio, tolerably common P.R.</p></div>

<p>The Carolina Wren is a bird of the woods, whose loud,
musical whistles are among the most conspicuous of southern
bird notes. They suggest those of both the Cardinal
and Tufted Titmouse, but are more varied in character.
A common scolding call is recognizably wren-like, while
another suggests a tree-toad's <i>krrring</i>. The nest is built
in holes, in April. The 4-6 eggs are white with numerous
reddish brown and lavender markings.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BEWICK'S WREN<br />

<p>A house Wren of the States west of the Alleghanies with
a tail that seems to be at the mercy of passing breezes,
and a song resembling the Song Sparrow's, but louder.
Its nesting habits resemble those of the House Wren. The

<p>The familiar inhabitant of our bird-houses whose numbers
seem limited only by the nesting-sites we offer him.
His little fountain of melody bubbles forth irrepressibly
to cheer his mate or challenge a rival. With the exhaustless

<p>The Winter Wren comes to us from the North when the
House Wren leaves for the South and remains with us
until the House Wren returns in the spring. But one
by no means takes the place of the other. The Winter
Wren is a wood Wren that lives in fallen tree-tops, old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
brush-piles or similar retreats, and his nervous <i>chimp,
chimp</i>, as with cocked-up tail he hops into view for a
second, is like the call of the Song Sparrow rather than the
scolding note of most Wrens; nor does his rippling, trickling
song resemble the House Wren's sudden outburst.</p>

<p>The nest is built in the roots of a tree or similar location.
The 5-7 eggs, laid in early June, are white, finely, but
rather sparingly speckled with brownish.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />SHORT-BILLED MARSH WREN<br />

<i>Cistothorus stellaris. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 80</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smallest of our Wrens; the head and back streaked with white.
L. 4.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from central Missouri and northern Delaware
to Saskatchewan and southern Maine; winters from southern
Illinois and southern New Jersey to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Washington, very rare T.V., two instances, May. Ossining,
rare S.R., to Oct. 16. Cambridge, formerly locally common
S.R., May 12-Sept. 25; now chiefly T.V. N. Ohio, rare, May

<p>Although we have only six species of Wrens in the eastern
United States, they are so unlike in their choice of haunts
that few localities which will afford them the hiding places
they all love are without one or more of them. The
House and Bewick's Wrens make their homes near ours;
the Carolina and Winter Wrens prefer the woods; the
Long-billed Marsh Wren's haunts have given him his
name, and if we should call the present species Meadow
Wren, its home would be similarly indicated, for it lives
in wet, grassy places rather than among the cat-tails.</p>

<p>Ernest Seton describes its note as resembling the sound
produced by striking two pebbles together, while its song
is a series of <i>chaps</i>, running into <i>chap-r-r-rrr</i>. The
globular nest is built on the ground, and the 6-8 eggs, laid
in May, are usually pure white.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />LONG-BILLED MARSH WREN<br />

<i>Telmatodytes palustris palustris. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 79</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Darker and larger than the Short-billed Marsh Wren, with a
blackish brown crown and white stripe over the eye. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Virginia to Canada; winters from southern
New Jersey to South Carolina. Worthington's Marsh Wren
(<i>T. p. griseus</i>) is the form of the Atlantic coast from South Carolina
to Florida. Marian's Marsh Wren (<i>T. p. marian&aelig;</i>) is
found on the more southern Atlantic coast and on the Gulf coast
of Florida; while the Prairie Marsh Wren (<i>T. p. iliacus</i>) nests
in the Mississippi Valley east to Indiana north to Canada, and
winters along the Gulf coast. Where two races may be expected
to occur together (for example, in the South, during the winter)
field identification of the various races may be left to experts
and the average observer must be content with plain "Marsh
Wren."</p>

<p>Washington, very numerous S.R., Apl. 15-Nov. 1. Ossining,
common S.R., May 10-Oct. 28. Cambridge, locally abundant
S.R., May 15-Oct. 1; sometimes a few winter. N. Ohio, common

<p>As well look for pond lilies on a rocky hillside as a
Marsh Wren outside a marsh. Give him cat-tails for cover
and to support his bulky nest and he is at home. His
scolding notes betray his ancestry and his reeling, rippling
song, delivered both from a perch and on fluttering wings
above the reeds, suggests in form, at least, that of the
House Wren. The 5-9 eggs, laid in early June are uniform
chocolate or thickly marked with brown.</p>

<h2>CREEPERS. FAMILY CERTHIID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BROWN CREEPER<br />

<i>Certhia familiaris americana. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 59</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Tail-feathers with stiffened points, bill slender and slightly
carved. L. 5&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England and south along the
Alleghanies to North Carolina; winters south to Florida.</p>

<p>Washington, common W.V., Sept. 22-May 1. Ossining, tolerably
common W.V., Sept. 20-May 7. Cambridge, common T.V.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

common W.V., Sept. 15-May 19. SE. Minn., common T.V.,
uncommon W.V., Sept. 25-Mch. 30.</p></div>

<p>To see the Brown Creeper is to knew him but so inconspicuous
is he that unless you chance to observe him drop
from one to tree near the foot of another, you may overlook
the little figure creeping spirally upward. Nor are
his thin, weak, squeaky call-notes more likely to attract
attention than he is himself. A true bird of the bark, he
not only hunts upon it but builds his nest behind it,
laying 5-8 white, brown-spotted eggs in May.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>NUTHATCHES. FAMILY SITTID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WHITE-BREASTED NUTHATCH<br />

<i>Sitta carolinensis carolinensis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 38, 39; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>,
Fig. 65</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Crown black, cheeks white; breast white; the female with a
gray crown. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Gulf States to Canada; a Permanent
Resident. The Florida White-breasted Nuthatch (<i>S. c. atkinsi</i>)
a slightly smaller form in which the female as well as the male
has the crown black, is the race inhabiting Florida, the Atlantic
coast to South Carolina and the Gulf coast to Mississippi.</p>

<p>Washington, common T.V. and W.V., less common S.R.
Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, P.R., rare in summer,
uncommon in winter, common in migrations; most numerous in
Oct. and Nov. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen Ellyn, fairly
common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.</p></div>

<p>During the summer we will see comparatively little of
this bird who, with equal ease, climbs either down or up a
tree trunk, but in the winter he will be a constant patron
of the nuts and suet on our lunch counters. Habit,
markings, his unmistakable <i>yank-yank</i>, all distinguish him
from our other birds, except his Canadian cousin to which,
after all, he bears only a family resemblance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>In April, 5-7 white, brown speckled eggs are laid in a
hole in a tree, lined with feathers, etc.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RED-BREASTED NUTHATCH<br />

<i>Sitta canadensis. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 60, 61</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Underparts brownish, a line through the eye, black in the male,
slate in the female. Smaller than the White-breasted Nuthatch.
L. 4&frac34;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England and northern
Minnesota into Canada; south along the Alleghanies to North
Carolina; winters from southern Canada to the Gulf States.</p>

<p>Washington, irregularly abundant W.V., sometimes rare,
Sept. 15-May 10. Ossining, irregular W.V., Aug. 8-May 8.
Cambridge, irregular T.V., and W.V., Aug. 15-Nov. 25; Nov.
25-Apl. 15. N. Ohio, tolerably common W.V., Sept. 4-May 22.
Glen Ellyn, irregular T.V., Apl. 24-May 21; Aug. 19-Dec. 12.
SE. Minn., common T.V., uncommon W.V., Sept. 24-Apl. 21.</p></div>

<p>Late in August when I hear a note such as one might
imagine a baby Nuthatch would utter, I know that the
Red-breasted Nuthatch has arrived from the north perhaps
to spend the winter, or, may be, to go farther south.
He never seems quite as familiar as his larger, louder-voiced,
white-breasted cousin, and if one wants to make his
acquaintance it is well to follow the sound of his penny-trumpet-like
notes until their author is discovered.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BROWN-HEADED NUTHATCH<br />

<i>Sitta pusilla. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 66</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The head is browner than in the figure; the nape has a downy
white patch. Smallest of our Nuthatches. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Florida to southern Delaware and southern
Missouri; a Permanent Resident.</p></div>

<p>The Brown-headed Nuthatch is a bird of southern pine
forests; one may travel for miles without seeing a single
individual and then discover a company of a score or more.
They pass most of their time among the upper branches
uttering a <i>pit-pit</i> as they hunt for food, or all suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
joining in a metallic <i>tnee-tnee-tnee</i>, when they are apt to
take flight to the adjoining trees. The nest is in a hole
in a tree or stump, generally near the ground; 5-6 white,
heavily marked eggs being laid in March.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>TITMICE. FAMILY PARID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />TUFTED TITMOUSE<br />

<i>B&aelig;olophus bicolor. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 67</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A large, gray Titmouse, with a conspicuous crest, black forehead,
and reddish brown flanks. L. 6.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from the Gulf States north to New Jersey and
Nebraska. Resident, except at the northern limit of its range.</p>

<p>Washington, very common P.R., more so in winter. N. Ohio,
common P.R. Glen Ellyn, only two records, Apl. 4 and Nov. 19.</p></div>

<p>The loud <i>peto, peto, peto</i> of the Tufted Tit can be confused
only with certain notes of the Carolina Wren, but while
skilfull stalking is required to see the Wren, one may walk
up and inspect the Tit with little or no caution. When he
sees us he may change his call to a hoarse <i>dee-dee-dee</i> which
at once betrays his relationship to the Chickadee. The
nest is made in a hole, and the 5-8 white, brown-marked
eggs are laid in April.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE<br />

<i>Penthestes atricapillus atricapillus. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Fig. 37</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Crown black, wing-coverts margined with whitish. L. 5&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from central Missouri and northern New Jersey
north into Canada, south, along the Alleghanies to North Carolina;
winters south to Maryland.</p>

<p>Washington, rare and irregular W.V., Oct. 19-Apl. 19. Ossining,
tolerably common P.R. Cambridge, common P.R., more
numerous in fall and winter. N. Ohio, common P.R. Glen
Ellyn, fairly common P.R. SE. Minn., common P.R.</p></div>

<p>While the Chickadee is with us throughout the year, it
is during the winter that he takes first place in our affections.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Active, cheerful, friendly, he is an ever welcome
visitor to our lunch-counters, and often shows complete
and winning confidence in us by perching on our hands.
His clearly enunciated <i>chick-a-dee</i>, with its variations, we
accept as his characteristic language, but the sentiment
expressed in his two- or three-noted whistle seems to
belong to the Pewee rather than the sprightly Black-cap.
It is, in fact, often falsely attributed to that bird, even
when our books tell us that the Pewee is wintering in the
tropics!</p>

<p>The Chickadee nests in holes, usually within ten feet
of the ground, laying 5-9 white, brown-speckled eggs in the
first half of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />CAROLINA CHICKADEE<br />

<i>Penthestes carolinensis carolinensis. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 68</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smaller than the Black-cap; without white margins on the
wing-coverts. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Southeastern United States, north to northern New
Jersey and central Missouri. The south Florida form (<i>P. c.
impiger</i>) is slightly smaller and darker.</p>

<p>Washington, very common P.R., particularly in winter.</p></div>

<p>Whether because of a different temperament or because
milder winters make him less dependent on man's bounty,
the Carolina Chickadee does not show that unquestioning
confidence in our good faith which makes the Black-cap
so dear to us.</p>

<p>The <i>chick-a-dee</i> note is less clearly and more hurriedly
given by the Carolina, and the <i>pe-wee</i> whistle is not so loud
and usually consists of four notes instead of two. The
nesting habits and eggs of the two species are alike, but the
southern bird begins to lay in March.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BROWN-CAPPED CHICKADEE<br />

<i>Penthestes hudsonicus</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Similar to the Black-cap but crown dark brown; back brownish
ashy.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Northern New England and Canada; rarely further
south in winter. Represented by three races: the Acadian
Brown-capped Chickadee (<i>P. h. littoralis</i>) of northern New England,
New Brunswick. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; the
Labrador Brown-capped Chickadee (<i>P. h. nigricans</i>) of Labrador,
and the Hudsonian Brown-capped Chickadee (<i>P. h. hudsonicus</i>)
of the region west of Hudson Bay.</p></div>

<p>Until recent years the Brown-capped Chickadee was
rarely seen far south of its breeding range, but during several
winters it has invaded New England in considerable
numbers and has been found in the lower Hudson Valley,
Long Island, Staten Island and northern New Jersey.
At close range an experienced observer may know it by
its dark brown head, while Brewster states that its "nasal,
drawling, <i>tchick, chee-day-day</i>" at once distinguishes it
from the Black-cap. All three races have been reported
in these winter migrations and only expert examination
of specimens can determine whether the little wanderer is
from Labrador, New Brunswick, or the country west of
Hudson Bay.</p>

<h2>OLD-WORLD WARBLERS, KINGLETS AND GNATCATCHERS. FAMILY SYLVIID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GOLDEN-CROWNED KINGLET<br />

<i>Regulus satrapa satrapa. <a href="#Case_2">Case 2</a>, Figs. 62, 63; <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Figs. 72, 73</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Very small, olive-green birds with a flame and yellow crown-patch
in the male and a yellow crown-patch in the female. L. 4.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New England northward and,
in the Alleghanies, south to North Carolina.</p>

<p>Washington, abundant W.V., Sept. 30-Apl. 27. Ossining,
common W.V., Sept. 20-Apl. 28. Cambridge, very common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

W.V., Sept. 19-May 8. SE. Minn., common T.V., Mch. 30-;
Sept. 21-Dec. 1.</p></div>

<p>It is surprising, in the depth of winter, when in great
coat and muffler we keep warm only by vigorous exercise,
to see these dainty, feathered mites, unconcerned by the
temperature, flitting here and there in their search for
insects' eggs and larv&aelig;. They have small fear of man and
we may readily approach near enough to hear their thin
<i>ti-ti</i> or see their golden-crown. In proportion to its size,
this diminutive species lays a larger number of eggs than
any other of our birds, as many as 9 or 10 white, brown-marked
eggs being laid in their pensile, mossy nest in the
latter part of May.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET<br />

<i>Regulus calendula calendula. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>. Figs. 70, 71; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>. Figs.
36, 37</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A white eye-ring; two whitish wing-bars, no white in the tail;
adult male with a ruby crown-patch; absent in females and
young. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests chiefly north of the United States; winters from
Virginia and Iowa southward.</p>

<p>Washington, abundant T.V., Apl. 12-May 15; Sept. 25-Nov. 1;

19; Sept. 9-Oct. 27. SE. Minn., Mch. 12-; Sept. 18-Oct.
24.</p></div>

<p>A tiny, olive-green bird, with a large white eye-ring,
fluttering actively among the yellowing leaves, uttering
from time to time a wren-like <i>cack</i> as he twitches his wings
and showing little or no fear of man can be only the Ruby-crown,
southward bound. He returns before the trees are
clad, as the author of a song as marvelous in volume as it
is musical in tone; a whistled song of rare sweetness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUE-GRAY GNATCATCHER<br />

<i>Polioptila c&aelig;rulea c&aelig;rulea. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>. Fig. 69</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A slender, gray mite with a comparatively long tail of which
the central feathers are black, the outer ones white. L. 4&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from the Gulf States to southern Wisconsin and
southern New Jersey; winters from the Gulf States southward.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common S.R., Mch. 30-Nov. 23. N.
Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Sept. 15. Glen Ellyn, not common
S.R., Apl. 22-Aug. 20; possibly later. SE. Minn., rare S.R.</p></div>

<p>In color, form, proportions and voice, the Gnatcatcher
may properly be called 'dainty.' His slightly explosive
call-note <i>tin-ng</i>, is louder than his exquisitely finished,
varied, miniature song. The nest is almost as fine in
workmanship as a Hummer's. The 4-5 white, thickly
speckled eggs, are laid in April and early May.</p>

<h2>THRUSHES, BLUEBIRDS, ETC. FAMILY TURDID&AElig;</h2>


<div class='center'><br /><br />WOOD THRUSH<br />

<i>Hylocichla mustelina. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 74</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Head brighter than tail; underparts <i>white</i>, heavily spotted with
large, round black dots. Largest of our Thrushes. L. 8&frac14;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Florida and Texas north to central Minnesota
and southern New Hampshire; winters in the tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., Apl. 10-Oct. 10. Ossining,
common S.R., Apl. 30-Oct. 2. Cambridge, locally common
S.R., May 10-Sept. 15. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct.
1. Glen Ellyn, fairly common S.R., Apl. 30-Sept. 29
SE. Minn., common S.R., May 1-Sept. 19.</p></div>

<p>Most familiar of our Thrushes. From late April to
early August his bell-like notes are heard, not only in the
forest, but in wood-bordered village streets and from the
shade trees of our lawns. His sharp, pebbly, <i>pit-pit</i>, is
prominent in the chorus of protesting notes which greet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the Screech Owl should he leave his retreat before diurnal
birds have gone to bed.</p>

<p>The nest is usually built in small trees about 8 feet from
the ground. The 3-5 greenish blue eggs are laid in May.
There is a second brood in June.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />VEERY<br />

<i>Hylocichla fuscescens fuscescens. <a href="#Case_6">Case 6</a>, Fig. 73</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Upperparts, including tail, uniform cinnamon-brown, breast
buff with indistinct brownish spots; sides white. L. 7&frac12;.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from northern New Jersey and northern Illinois
into Canada and south in the Alleghanies to Georgia; winters in
the tropics. A closely related western form, the Willow Thrush
(<i>H. f. salicicola</i>) nests in Minnesota and westward, and migrates
through the Mississippi Valley. To the field naturalist it is
essentially the Veery.</p>

<p>Washington, common T.V., Apl. 26-June 2. Aug. 18-Sept. 25.
Ossining, common S.R., Apl. 29-Sept. 5. Cambridge, locally
abundant S.R., May 8-Sept. 5. N. Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 20-Oct.
1. Glen Ellyn, tolerably common T.V., Apl. 24-May 29;
Aug. 26-Sept. 3; SE. Minn., common S.R. May 5.</p></div>

<p>Low, wet woods with considerable undergrowth, where
skunk cabbage and hellebore flourish are the home of the
Veery. Here he winds his mysterious double-toned spiral
song, and here, on the ground, hidden beneath the rank
vegetation, he builds his nest. The eggs, laid late in May,
resemble those of the Wood Thrush. The Veery's common
call is a clearly whistled <i>whe&eacute;-you</i>, quite unlike the <i>quirt</i> or
<i>pit-pit</i> of the Wood Thrush. Except in mountainous
regions and some local 'stations,' the Wood Thrush and
Veery are the only Thrushes which nest in the eastern
United States south of Massachusetts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />GRAY-CHEEKED THRUSH<br />

<i>Hylocichla alici&aelig; alici&aelig;. <a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 82</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Upperparts uniform olive; eye-ring whitish, not buffy as in the
Olive-backed Thrush (<a href="#Case_8">Case 8</a>, Fig. 81); sides of throat and
breast less buffy than in the Olive-back. L. 7&frac12;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests north of the United States. Bicknell's Thrush
(<i>H. a. bicknelli</i>) a slightly smaller, southern form, nests in the
higher parts of the Catskills, the mountains of northern New
York and northern New England, and northward and eastward
into Canada; both visit us in migration and both winter in the
tropics.</p>

<p>Washington, rather common T.V., May 8-31; Sept. 15-Oct. 20.
Ossining, tolerably common T.V., May 15-June 1; Sept. 20-Oct.
17. Cambridge, uncommon T.V., May 18-28; Sept. 15-Oct.

Ellyn, common T.V., May 7-June 4; Aug. 26-Oct. 9. SE.
Minn., common T.V., May 7-; Sept. 8.</p></div>

<p>The Gray-cheeked and Bicknell's Thrushes are merely
the larger northern and smaller southern forms, respectively,
of the same species. They are known in the
United States chiefly as migrants and can be distinguished
with certainty in life only by an expert under favorable
conditions. The larger form is the commoner. The species
may be known from the Veery and Wood Thrush by
its olive, instead of cinnamon-brown back, and from the
Olive-backed Thrush by its whitish eye-ring and paler
breast.</p>

<p>Brewster describes the song of the southern form
(Bicknell's Thrush) as exceedingly like that of the Veery
but more interrupted, while the ordinary call-note is
practically identical with the <i>pheu</i> of the Veery. The nest
is placed in low trees or bushes. The eggs are greenish
blue spotted with brown.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH<br />

<p>We know this Thrush chiefly as a migrant when, in the
latter part of May, and again in September and October,
it passes us <i>en route</i> to and from its northern home. At
these seasons we may even hear its whistled <i>puit</i> from the
sky as it journeys through the night. "Its song," Dwight
says, "lacks the leisurely sweetness of the Hermit Thrush's
outpourings, nor is there pause, but in lower key and with
greater energy it bubbles on rapidly to a close rather than
fading out with the soft melody of its renowned rival."</p>

<p>The Olive-back nests in bushes or low trees, and lays
3-4 greenish blue brown-spotted eggs in June.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Back midway in color between Figs. 77 and 26; the tail noticeably

<p>The Hermit is the only one of the Thrushes to winter in
the eastern United States and it is, therefore, the first one
to reach us in the spring. It comes early in April and takes
about a month to complete its migration. It rarely sings
at this season and then only an echo of the heavenly music
which has won for it first place among American songsters.</p>

<p>We may know the Hermit Thrush by the season in
which he visits us, by his reddish brown tail, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
slowly raises and lowers after alighting, and by the
low <i>chuck</i> note with which he usually accomplishes this
movement.</p>

<p>The Hermit nests on the ground, laying, in the latter
part of May, 3-4 greenish-blue eggs, slightly lighter in tint
than those of the Wood Thrush.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />ROBIN<br />

<i>Planesticus migratorius migratorius. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 80; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>,
Fig. 12</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In spring and summer the head is blacker, the breast brighter,
the bill more yellow than in fall and winter. L. 10.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from Virginia (in the mountains, northern
Georgia) and northern Mississippi to Labrador and Alaska;
winters from New Jersey and Ohio Valley to the Gulf. Birds
from the lowlands, from Maryland southward, are somewhat
smaller and paler and are known as the Southern Robin (<i>P. m.
achrusterus</i>).</p>

<p>Washington, rather common S.R., abundant T.V., from Feb-Apl.;
irregularly common W.V. Ossining, common S.R., Mch.

<p>The Robin is the best-known and probably most abundant
of our native birds. Civilization agrees with him.
Man has destroyed many of his enemies and has provided
him with a bountiful supply of fruits and a vast area of
lawns where worms are at his mercy. Sociable and trustful
he has taken up his abode with us and become as much
a part of our outdoor life as the flowers in our gardens
and trees in our lawns. His varied calls have an intimate
association with the hour and season and spring itself
speaks through his cheerful song.</p>

<p>Robins show their confidence in us by building their
nests in situations where few birds would venture to rear
a family, and from mid-April to July they are occupied
with household cares.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><br />BLUEBIRD<br />

<i>Sialis sialis sialis. <a href="#Case_4">Case 4</a>, Fig. 78; <a href="#Case_5">Case 5</a>, Fig. 13</i></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Bluebird's red, white and blue mark him as a truly American
bird. L. 7.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i> Nests from the Gulf States to Florida; winters from
Connecticut and northern Ohio southward.</p>

<p>Washington, common S.R., and W.V. Ossining, common
P.R. Cambridge, common S.R., Mch. 6-Nov. 1; more numerous
during migrations, in Mch. and Nov. N. Ohio, common
S.R., Feb. 17-Nov. 18; a few winter. Glen Ellyn, fairly common
S.R., Feb. 19-Nov. 18. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 16-Oct.

<p>Not many years ago the Bluebird was as familiar as he
was welcome about our homes; but too gentle to battle
effectively with English Sparrows and Starlings for the
possession of bird houses, he has sought such nesting sites
in the orchard as the 'tree surgeons' have left. If we
would not lose this bird, "beloved of children, bards and
spring," who wears our national colors so modestly, we must
supply him with a home in which he may rear his family
in peace. It may be placed not only in our garden, but
also in the orchard where it is less likely to be occupied by
Sparrows or Starlings. It should be erected not later than
March 15, for the Bluebird's bluish white eggs are laid in
the first half of April.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
